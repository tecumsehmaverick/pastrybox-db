She had inherited it from her own mother who also read it at her bedside when she was little. Eventually I grew more confident of my own reading skills and finished it by myself. That novel is how I learned my very first lessons on morals, justice and love. I\u2019ve read many other books since then, but that one always holds a very special place in my heart, as it practically shaped my character.<\/p><p>It taught me to strive to see the good in others, even when they are doing everything in their power to hide it. Our mistrust is our armor and we\u2019re terrified that giving it up will lead to more pain and disappointment. However, I\u2019ve found that expecting good often brings out the best in others too.

They were promoting a stellar new album (<cite>The Seer<\/cite>) which essentially encompasses all of the varied and challenging music that bandleader Michael Gira has made under a few different monikers over the last thirty years. In the two years since I saw them last, I had gotten to know their oeuvre better, and coming to this show with a more educated ear paid off. Swans\u2019 allure can be difficult to explain since their output is generally pretty ugly by conventional standards, but their live show has helped me fill in a piece of that allure\u2019s puzzle: their music is intensely physical.<\/p><p>Part of it has to do with the sound being produced organically, from musical instruments and non-instruments alike, and the ability of that sound to embody the physical act \u2014 from delicate precision to chaotic, flailing abandon \u2014 with which it was derived. Modern production techniques have a way of making music sound like it just <em>happens<\/em>, but one never doubts that a Swans record is the result of manual labor, and that labor is made manifest in the band\u2019s apocalyptic live show.<\/p><p>But there is another not-so-secret physical ingredient that pushes a Swans show into transcendent territory: extremely high volume. How loud is it? Well, it occurred to me that a deaf person might get nearly as much out of the show as I did. It is loud enough to make your insides rumble, effectively forcing you to listen with your entire body. And this makes the experience that much more immersive: if you\u2019re already attuned to the emotional and intellectual qualities of the music, the volume will penetrate you physically as well. A Swans show can and will overtake the whole of one\u2019s being.<\/p><p>Later, I wondered if the experience was made more acute by physicality\u2019s diminished relevance in a modern life dominated by abstract interactions with pixels behind glass.<\/p><p>A wide range of experiences that used to be physically distinct from each other now share the homogenous tactility of our digital devices. Not so long ago, I couldn\u2019t possibly mistake my copy of <cite>Slaughterhouse Five<\/cite> for my telephone\u2019s handset, but now, when I reach for one, I am inescapably reaching for both. Granted, these experiences do have a fundamental thing in common \u2014 the movement of ideas \u2014 and the paper and plastic that accompanied them in the past were artifacts of less efficient means of distribution than what we have now. Consolidating the material components of these experiences was the right thing to do.<\/p><p>But that doesn\u2019t mean our senses of touch, taste, and smell aren\u2019t every bit as important as their siblings.

When her grandparents were born, that expectancy\nwas much closer to 70 years.\n\nSo, my daughters, and their generation, have a lot of the future in front of them.\n\nWhen I was growing up, the future looked like colonies on Mars, and holidays in space, and flying cars, and\njetpacks, and video phones. We kind of got video phones, and no one really cares all that much about\nthose.\n\nThe future we didn\u2019t know about, or didn\u2019t think much about was AIDS, and massive population growth, and\nglobal climate change, and the fall of the Soviet Union (many of you won\u2019t have even known a time when the\nSoviet Union existed, let alone posed (supposedly) the greatest existential threat to humanity).\n\nThe future I talk about in these Pastry Box pieces is pretty trivial by comparison. If there\u2019s anything\namong them that aspires to be more than just a few thoughts about the next few years, it\u2019s the idea that the\ntechnologies of the web provide us with the opportunity to be more honest with ourselves, as individuals,\nabout our actions (what we eat, drink, buy, how we act, where we travel) and their consequences, for\nourselves, and for the billions of others on our planet, and as a civilisation, as a planet as a whole.\n\nWe face monumental challenges to our very existence as a species. So far we\u2019ve been pretty good at sticking\nour heads in the sand. That time is over.\n\nIf we want a future at all, let alone one with jetpacks and holidays in space, we need to start accepting\nreality, then talking about how to fix the problems that are essentially of our own making.\n\nAnd thank goodness we have the web, and the ability to communicate across borders, and language and cultural\nbarriers at this time. Because without that I honestly believe we\u2019d have no hope at all.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @johnallsopp on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/john-allsopp\/20-12-2012","role":"guest","realname":"John Allsopp","slug":"john-allsopp","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/john-allsopp\/2012-december-20","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2242417499\/image_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1355904000","date":"2012-december-19","nicedate":"Wednesday, 19 December 2012","title":"","thought":"<h1>Retreat.

Or one of history&#8217;s failures?<\/p><p>Either way, I can&#8217;t wait to see what the future holds.<\/p>","thought_markdown":"\n\nWhen I was in fourth grade, I was given an assignment to interview a family member and then to write their\nbiography. I chose my great-grandfather, who was born in 1900. Interviewing him in the early 1980s, his life\nstory was fascinating: he remembered the first time he\u2019d seen an automobile, the first moving picture he\nsaw, the first time he saw something man-made in the air, the first time he\u2019d heard a radio, the first\nhe saw a television. In his lifetime, humanity went from horse-drawn buggy to walking on the moon. Everything\nI take for granted was once new to him.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of this because my generation will have a parallel story, though likely less dramatic, to\ntell. My children cannot remember a day without the internet. \n\nMy first encounter with a web browser was in the early nineties. I had entered the computer lab in order to\nprint out a term paper, and a friend of mine waved me over. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see this!\u201d He had\nthis window open, and typed something in and suddenly we were seeing a news report about the spread of the\nEbola virus, accompanied by __pictures__. It was grotesque and fascinating.\n\nA few years later, I was working at an engineering research center, and tasked with putting together an online\nglossary, and finally got to see how such pages were put together. HTML reminded me of working in WordPerfect\ndocuments, which, back then, had a mode that allowed you to work directly with the declarative codes used to\nalter the appearance of text.\n\nFast forward to the year 2000. I was working at a small publisher and book catalog. We\u2019d recently moved\nour online catalog in-house, thanks to the fact that our catalog software had a module for IIS. I was asked to\ngive the site a new look, since I\u2019d done some HTML before. I quickly discovered that the HTML was not\nhard-coded, but being generated by this language called \u201cActive Server Pages\u201d. I figured out what\nneeded to be done.\n\nA few months later, my boss noticed that this up and coming company, and competitor, really,\n\u201cAmazon,\u201d was now allowing people to review books on their site. He asked me to add that feature\nto the site.\n\nThe software we had used FoxPro, and while I could get things out of it, I couldn\u2019t quite figure out how\nto put things *into* it, particularly not in a way that would allow us to upgrade easily. So I did some\nresearch, and decided to use Perl to accomplish the task. I got some books, studied hard for a few weeks,\nadded Perl and MySQL to our IIS installation, and banged out the functionality.\n\nAnd at that point, I was hooked by the web, and specifically creating content for the web.\n\nToday, I have two kids. Neither of them knows a world without the web. They\u2019ve never seen a regular\nmodem, much less a phone that connects to the wall, or with an actual dial. How foreign will my life be to\ntheir children, and their children\u2019s children? And will the internet as I first saw it be only the first\nin a pioneering step towards bigger and better technology? Or one of history\u2019s failures?\n\nEither way, I can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @mwop on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/matthew-weier-ophinney\/17-12-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Matthew Weier O'Phinney","slug":"matthew-weier-ophinney","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/matthew-weier-ophinney\/2012-december-17","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/58517578\/logo_bigger.gif"},{"pubdate":"1355644800","date":"2012-december-16","nicedate":"Sunday, 16 December 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>Rejoice, for \u258a is dead!

Opening notes or chords so deeply ingrained in your subconscious that you can almost \u2018become\u2019 a past version of yourself in an instant? I can think of a few songs that have that effect on me and most are seasonal. This time of year, December specifically, there\u2019s a song that\u2019s been playing in my head since I was 15. That song is&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thirty-Three_(song)\">\u2018Thirty-Three\u2019<\/a>&nbsp;by The Smashing Pumpkins (<a href=\"http:\/\/open.spotify.com\/track\/00V8OQOPSvaA9Sl3FxhiCw\">Spotify<\/a>\/&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rdio.com\/artist\/The_Smashing_Pumpkins\/album\/Mellon_Collie_And_The_Infinite_Sadness\/track\/Thirty-Three\/\">Rdio<\/a>&nbsp;\/&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/AYSbztCCTlA\">YouTube<\/a>).<\/p><p>So I\u2019m 15 again. Christmas 1996 is approaching. On my Christmas list is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mellon_Collie_and_the_Infinite_Sadness\">\u2018Melon Collie and The Infinite Sadness\u2019<\/a>, the Pumpkins\u2019 epic landmark two-disc album. \u2018Thirty-Three\u2019 is a song on disc two, but at this point I\u2019ve yet to hear it \u2014 I have to wait until Christmas Day for that. But here I am on a cold Saturday morning, thumbing through CDs in a small independent (and ultimately doomed) record store in my hometown of Orpington, Kent, about to hear the song for the first time. In the \u2018singles\u2019 section, \u2018Thirty-Three\u2019 is a new release. There are two versions available, each with different b-sides. I buy&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/discogs.com\/Smashing-Pumpkins-Thirty-Three\/release\/1120726\">the version<\/a>&nbsp;that includes \u2018The Last Song\u2019 \u2014 an absolutely beautiful track that features a guitar solo from Billy Corgan\u2019s father \u2014 \u2018The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right)\u2019, and \u2018Transformer\u2019.<\/p><p>Of the days that followed that purchase, I have no specific memory. I assume I played the single a lot \u2014 especially the first two songs \u2014 in the run-up to Christmas, and I know that I did indeed receive the full album on Christmas Day. But the specifics are irrelevant: the residual feeling is what mattered (to me, at least).<\/p><p>At that time in my life, I\u2019d recently broken up with my first girlfriend and, being a rather emotional and \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 somewhat pathetic fifteen year-old (long before the term \u2018emo\u2019 was coined, of course), life was filled with a sense of bittersweet melancholy, fueled by the discovery of music that remains poignant to this day. Life also had an air of innocence: I lived at home with my parents, I was mid-way through high school, and I\u2019d yet to start my first job. The web had just started to turn into \u2018a thing\u2019, but I wasn\u2019t aware of it.<\/p><p>This little bout of reminiscing has no point.

I could change my sleeping pattern so I was more productive. I could read more books. I could learn something new every day. I could create a product I previously thought to be impossible.

Thinking about the temporary nature of my craft motivated me to learn more about something less temporary \u2014 its roots. The foundations of design. Typography, grid systems, color theory. So I bought books. And I learned more. I hated reading, but it was easy to read about something I was genuinely passionate about.

And that seems like a reasonable boundary: the amount of work required of the audience for comprehension is determined by the content creator, and the designer\u2019s job is to find the best way to present that content appropriately for the audience.

I absorb a lot of it, all of which is presumably stored somewhere,\nbut not nearly as much of it remains available for unassisted recall as I would like. Not surprisingly, the\nstuff that is best remembered has been reinforced, usually through some kind of repeated application or\nextensive immersion. In other words, if something is retained in my long-term memory, I probably had to work\nfor it. Fair enough. Accordingly, my long-term memory is full of stuff that has been experienced with\nregularity, has spoken directly to my natural curiosity, and\/or has given me a meaningful challenge that\nI\u2019ve managed to meet.\n\nMany of those meaningful challenges have come from various forms of art, and a recent visit to a [Quay\nBrothers exhibition](http:\/\/www.moma.org\/visit\/calendar\/exhibitions\/1240) at the Museum of Modern Art offered\na good reminder of why that is. One of my favorite films from the Quays is a short documentary called\n[Anamorphosis (or De Artificiali Perspective)](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5D80A04qmO0). It explores the\nartistic application of [anamorphosis](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anamorphosis), a technique for producing\ndistorted imagery that can only be comprehended by viewing it from a particular angle. While this technique\ncould easily be dismissed as a gimmick, the Quay Brothers make a point of discussing its\nvalue:\n\n> Anamorphosis is a most powerful device for controlling understanding.

For years, I\u2019ve argued that [the supposed commercial benefits to developers\nare largely illusory](http:\/\/www.webdirections.org\/blog\/iphone-native-apps-the-great-leap-backwards\/)\n(something I continue to believe, and which the last several years largely demonstrates).\n\nBut, my principal concern with apps was actually best expressed last year by Scott Jensen, legendary HCI\nexpert at Apple, Symbian, Google and now Frog Design, in his provocatively titled \u201c[Native Apps Must\nDie](http:\/\/designmind.frogdesign.com\/blog\/mobile-apps-must-die.html)\u201d.\n\n> Native\n> apps are a remnant of the Jurassic period of computer history, a local maximum that is holding us back. The\n> combination of a discovery service and just-in-time interaction is a powerful interaction model that native\n> apps can\u2019t begin to offer.\n\nApps are a model of functionality that has shaped both what developers and designers do, and how users\nconceive of what\u2019s possible more or less for the entire history of computing. But I think they are a\ndead end.\n\nOne interesting detour from the app-centric model of computing was the\n[Lisa](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Apple_Lisa) operating system, the not quite fore-runner to the Macintosh\nfrom Apple. Lisa differed markedly from the Macintosh, and other graphical operating systems, in that it was\ndocument centric. You didn\u2019t open applications to edit documents, you opened documents to work on them.\nUsers focussed on the task at hand, not the tool.\n\nChanging this conception of what a user experience might be is very difficult, so ingrained is the app-centric\nmodel with users, and among ourselves as designers and developers. But what might a more user-centric model\nlook like?\n\nLet\u2019s take a very popular consumer application\/service right now. Photo hosting. Well, it\u2019s been\npopular for quite some time, with services like Flickr now several years old, and then Instagram and numerous\nsimilar services emerging particularly with the rise of smart phones.\n\nBut all of these services are monolithic\u2014indeed are becoming more so. Most if not all of what a user can do\nwith them takes place inside one application (this is particularly true of services like Instagram). You\nshoot, apply effects, crop, tag, annotate and upload all within the application. In the case of Instagram you\nalso sign up, search, follow people, in short, access the entire Instagram experience from inside the\nInstagram app.\n\nWhile we think of apps and services like these as photo-sharing services, they aren\u2019t really. Instagram\nis an Instagram app. Facebook is a Facebook app. Twitter increasingly is a Twitter app (as soon as they can\nget rid of all those other pesky client apps). The application, the service, is an end in itself.\n\nSo, what might a user focussed, post-app photo sharing service (experience? thing?) (let\u2019s call it\nphUto) look like.\n\nAt its core, it would be a place to upload photos which people could view. Some users might want to apply\nfilters and effects to their photos. Now, if I were building phUto, I might build that functionality into it.\n__Or__, I might make it possible for other developers to provide the user this functionality, ideally in a way\nthat felt seamlessly part of phUto.\n\nUsers might want to search the photos stored at phUto. I could build a search engine, and results experience.\nOr, I could make it easy for developers to provide this functionality, and a way for my users to __easily\ndiscover__ these search services, and use them in a way that feels like it\u2019s a seamless experience.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nThere have been complex attempts to enable this in the past. [OpenDoc](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OpenDoc),\nan enormous undertaking by Apple in the mid 1990s was among the most sophisticated of such attempts.\nMicrosoft\u2019s ActiveX similarly was designed to enable unrelated pieces of functionality work together.\nBut recently, more lightweight approaches among them\n[Android](http:\/\/www.vogella.com\/articles\/AndroidIntent\/article.html) Intents and [Web](http:\/\/webintents.org)\nIntents.\n\nBut as much as the technology for enabling this is important, the underlying concept is crucial.\n\nThe app model essentially creates silos of functionality, carefully created for the user. It gives rise to\nfeature creep, and rewards large teams with lots of engineering resources over smaller teams and individuals\nwho focus on one thing they can do really well.\n\nPerhaps in a decade, or a century, we\u2019ll still be working with monolithic apps. But I suspect (and\ncertainly hope) not.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @johnallsopp on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/john-allsopp\/06-11-2012","role":"guest","realname":"John Allsopp","slug":"john-allsopp","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/john-allsopp\/2012-november-6","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2242417499\/image_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1352102400","date":"2012-november-5","nicedate":"Monday, 5 November 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>Summer is long over and fall arrives with a flurry of new activity: you recommit to old projects as new projects surface.

Dumas&#8217;s adventure via adversity stories were a band-aid for the almost-daily racial slights of school life at the time. Asimov&#8217;s grandeur distracted me from feeling dislocated at the irrelevant fact of me being mixed race. Tolkien&#8217;s nobility sustained me as I helped my Mum run a one-parent family.<\/p><p>When I was the age my eldest son is now, my father would cane me for staying up late reading after bedtime. Granted, I pretty much ignored his more polite requests, and used to hide under the covers with a torch, trying to listen out for the creak of his step on the stairs. It was impossible to simultaneously be immersed in the world on the page, and have the sensory keenness of a sentry in an observation post. My Dad always managed to catch me. I would grin in embarrassment, and almost admiration at his silent skill. Later, I would tightly coil up inside with trepidation when I was caught.

But the year I\u2019ve spent publishing with this system has been my most prolific one yet,\neven more than those halcyon days when the site was running on a robust CMS and the blogging zeitgeist was in\nfull force.\n\nThere are two specific, external factors that have had a substantial impact on my site\u2019s recent\nfecundity:\n\n *  __The Pastry Box Project__, a blog that collects the wisdom of thirty-one influential web professionals,\nwhich asks that I submit something once a month, and which you\u2019re visiting right now.\n\n *  __[Letterboxd](http:\/\/letterboxd.com\/)__, a social site for film buffs whose thoughtful design has\nencouraged me to write frequent short-form film reviews.\n\nIn the last year, 83% of the posts (and 73% of the word count) on my site were republished content I created\nfor The Pastry Box Project, Letterboxd, and a few other external sites, so I clearly have publishing systems\nother than my own to thank for the lion\u2019s share of the writing I\u2019ve done. Still, I\u2019ve grown to enjoy\nusing my site\u2019s laborious non-CMS, and I think it\u2019s encouraged my writing in its own way.\n\nFor one thing, there\u2019s a hand-crafted element to working in static text files that\u2019s very satisfying.\nMarking up the semantics of my writing in its native HTML environment feels like a more personal endeavor than\ntyping into a WYSIWYG interface meant to shield me from the complexity hiding beneath it. For another thing,\nthe sizable inconvenience of editing several files for every site update makes each post feel more\nconsequential, which has paradoxically made my approach to writing both more and less precious: I take extra\ntime to make sure everything is just right before publishing and I rarely get bogged down in minutia-driven\nrevisions after. So once something is done, it\u2019s done, and I can move on to the next thing.\n\nCreating a system that increases the work necessary to complete a task is understandably rare. But in this\ncase, I\u2019ve found the extra work to be more rewarding than the sensibly efficient alternative. Whether or not\nmy non-CMS is comparable to the differences between manual and automatic transmissions or artisanal and\nmanufactured products, there can be benefits to adding complexity to our relationships with the things we\ncreate and consume. So I\u2019ll be on the lookout for other areas where inefficiency is my friend.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @robweychert on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/rob-weychert\/19-10-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Rob Weychert","slug":"rob-weychert","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/rob-weychert\/2012-october-19","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1435427530\/rob-avatar_bigger.png"},{"pubdate":"1350547200","date":"2012-october-18","nicedate":"Thursday, 18 October 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>Last month, I was checking out the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/#!\/search\/?q=%23eecms\">#eecms Twitter feed<\/a>\u00a0for updates about ExpressionEngine, and I saw an update from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/amywitty\">Amy Witty<\/a>\u00a0who was trying <abbr title=\"ExpressionEngine\">EE<\/abbr> for the first time:<\/p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet center\"><p>Just bought my <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/search\/%23EECMS\">#EECMS<\/a> Freelance Version!

By\nlistening intently, especially concerning subjects for which I have no knowledge or vested interest, I\u2019ve\nbecome better at listening. And learning. Then, when it comes to a topic I do have some interest in, I\u2019m\nlearning how to suspend my own judgement. Conversations are no longer about the volley. The only\n\u201cvolley\u201d on my part is a relentless questioning, born of curiosity. And in the process, I am no\nlonger concerned with assimilating information. Rather, my goal is to see things the way that person sees\nthings.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the magical thing that happens next\u2026\n\nBy truly understanding a perspective other than your own, you\u2019ll end up with ideas that don\u2019t fit into\nyour worldview--ideas you can\u2019t simply assimilate. At this point, real change happens; you begin to\naccommodate these new ideas. Your internal world has to adapt itself to contrary ideas. Or, where there is\ndisagreement, you can articulate the flaw, whether it\u2019s in your understanding or theirs.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard that disagreements are born out of misunderstandings. But, it took learning about\nassimilation and accommodation for me to really understand \u2014 truly understand \u2014 how to get around these\nmisunderstandings. Now when someone disagrees with, say\u2026 a design decision I\u2019ve made, rather than jump to\ndefend that decision, I jump to inquisitiveness. I want to first see things the way they do, to be able to\nhold in my head two different perspectives, so the way forward can become obvious. Then, we can reconcile the\ndifferences. Most resistance, whether to a new design or a foreign idea, is born out of ambiguity.\n\nIn research, we're told to listen. But it\u2019s far too easy to filter what we observe through our own mental\nmodel \u2014 we do this without being aware that we are doing so. Thinking about accommodation has helped me to\nsuspend not only judgement, but assumptions. I approach each research conversation with a blank slate, anxious\nto learn what I don\u2019t know. \n\nSo, here\u2019s my challenge: This week, as you engage in normal conversation, practice some meta-cognition. Stop\nand think about your responses. Are you seeking to assimilate or accommodate new information?","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @stephenanderson on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/stephen-anderson\/17-10-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Stephen Anderson","slug":"stephen-anderson","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/stephen-anderson\/2012-october-17","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/17651212\/Photo_14_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1350374400","date":"2012-october-16","nicedate":"Tuesday, 16 October 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>If technology doesn&rsquo;t go the way we want it to (conjure up any techno-dystopia you like) history will blame us.

My decision is of course based on whether I like it or not, and also if it\u2019s\nvaluable. But even before I get to this point, some basic criteria has already been taken into account which\ninfluences my judgement. There are a few basic guidelines that you can keep in mind to have the best chance\nyour message will be heard. Always write in a personal way, and make sure your message also sounds personal,\nbut keep it brief and to the point. So always address people by their name, not with a simple \u201cHi\u201d\nor \u201cHello there\u201d, because to me this means the person doesn\u2019t really know me, and the\nmessage is part of some list that gets sent out.

There is a full circus of wonder packed into this miniature creature.\n\nThis short experience this morning makes me think I\u2019ve forgotten to seek awe. I literally mean that I have\nnot properly budgeted time for it. It is not hard to find. A simple blade of grass breaking ground is more\nthan enough to shut me up and remind me to stand silent and small before the vast sum of all creation. It\u2019s\nonly when I am placed firmly in that sum \u2013 as a handful of dust made living by the magic of a loving\ndesigner, standing alongside grass, and bugs, and birds, and oxygen, and bacteria \u2013 that I can be the\ndesigner I wish to be. It\u2019s then that I am most able to create with a tenuous marriage of wonder and\nutility.\n\nI need to return to some kind of discipline, a daily reminder to seek wonder. It\u2019s a more natural part of\nbeing a \u201cfine artist\u201d, but since becoming a designer I\u2019ve neglected the practice. This little\nhummingbird has me thinking about how I might effect a small moment of enjoyable awe in the web and mobile\nexperiences I create as a designer. How can the businesses I imagine and bring to life draw out wonder in\nthose it serves or in those who are employed by it?\n\nWhen everything in our work is pushing us toward convenience, through speed perhaps, we ought to stand still\nin the moving stream and reflect whether those efficiencies are making life for people truly richer, better,\nor fuller? I suspect we have lost some things that the analog taught us as we trudge up this digital path.\nI\u2019m going to see if I can re-find some of them.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @whale on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/matthew-smith\/20-09-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Matthew Smith","slug":"matthew-smith","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/matthew-smith\/2012-september-20","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1780903785\/squaredeye_336x336_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1348041600","date":"2012-september-19","nicedate":"Wednesday, 19 September 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>A bout of insomnia last summer led me to sign up for a free trial of Hulu Plus, which would let me use my iPad to catch up on episodes of <cite>Bob\u2019s Burgers<\/cite> I had missed earlier in the season.

They are not the same. And while there is (and should be) a lot of overlap in skills\u2014it&rsquo;s good to know what the designer you&rsquo;re hiring thinks is priority.<\/li><li>Recognizing these differences, know that a pretty coat of paint will not make your very real usability problems magically disappear. I&rsquo;ve said as much in conversations: &ldquo;So, to be clear, you&rsquo;re just looking for a shiny coat of paint right now, and you&rsquo;re not interested in fixing the problems that are going to stop people in their tracks&hellip;?!&rdquo; <\/li><li>Form labels, microcopy, instructional text\u2014this is core to an application. In fact, the best UIs often start as written conversations between the user and the system. Be wary of designers who layer copy into their lovely layouts, or worse, use &ldquo;lorem ipsum&rdquo; as a stand-in for functional copy; these are signs you&rsquo;ve hired a stylist and not a designer. (The same is true of visualizations\u2014good designers start with the data, not the pretty pictures!)<\/li><li>Don&rsquo;t look at a design or prototype as an approximation for what should be implemented. A good designer will sweat every detail. A 20px size difference, a change in the typeface, the timing of an animation\u2014these kinds of things make the difference between confusion and delight.<\/li><li><ol class=\"list-letters list-margin\"><li>Bring in the UX designer before you&rsquo;ve attempted any UI work. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times my clients have said &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d brought you in earlier!&rdquo; The UI changes are often enough to necessitate technical re-architecture. Starting with a good designer from day one will save you a lot of headaches later on\u2026<\/li><li>Of course, starting with an existing alpha version means requirements have been defined. In these cases a good designer can spend her time redefining how things get done in the UI (however, be wary of &ldquo;functional fixedness;&rdquo; I spend a lot of my time just getting everyone on the team\u2014designers included\u2014to see the problem in a different way, not the way it has been implemented).<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Listen for what your customer needs, not what they ask for. Good design (or UX) isn&rsquo;t about giving customers everything they request\u2014it&rsquo;s about listening to these needs and then showing the thing they can&rsquo;t articulate (unless they also have a good design sense!).<\/li><li>Iterate on a weekly or bi-weekly basis with real customers and users. Do not skip or marginalize this critical feedback loop. If you do, you risk building a product that no one else really cares about using.<\/li><li>Iterate with 5\u20137 different customers who have very different needs. If you design for a homogenous group of folks, you&rsquo;ll end up with the perfect system for a small minority; your system likely won&rsquo;t scale to accommodate the needs of a market. By testing with a diverse group of customers, you rise above specifics to see the patterns and common challenges. You create a product that addresses a market need.<\/li><li>Make sure your problem space is well researched and that you&rsquo;re beginning with customer input, not waiting for it later on (when it&rsquo;s too late to make significant changes).<\/li><li>Hire a dedicated front-end developer. Don&rsquo;t let your UI be the afterthought of back-end programming. There&rsquo;s too much going on in the UI to rely on libraries and frameworks. If you&rsquo;re doing anything at all unconventional, you&rsquo;ll need a good front-end dev to build these out. Better yet, pair this front-end dev with the designer so they can create and iterate together on functional prototypes. Then, once these designs have been vetted with customers, there&rsquo;s no documentation needed for styles or behaviors, or miscommunication in the dreaded &ldquo;handoff&rdquo;\u2014that stuff is already taken care of. The UI is ready to be hooked up to the back-end systems.<\/li><li>Good designers will care about your technology stack, to the extent that it affects the UI.<\/li><li>Design from the &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; (vs &ldquo;top down&rdquo;). What do I mean by this? In web apps, the structure of your app (IA) will emerge over time\u2014don&rsquo;t start with structure or navigation. Think about flows, scenarios, and activities. The structure of the site will emerge from specific page level designs. Start with a laser focus on a specific activity, then follow that thread into other areas of the app. Starting with a top down focus on structure and consistent UI elements often glosses over the details and minutiae that set apart a stellar product. And don&rsquo;t get hung up on inconsistent interaction and visual details that come about from this bottom up focus\u2014these details will be ironed out as time goes on. That said, if you start with a comprehensive UI framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation, this will help a designer be intentional about introducing inconsistencies. Not that I&rsquo;m admitting a personal flaw of mine or anything.<\/li><li>Don&rsquo;t force web site patterns on a web app. For example, don&rsquo;t waste your time thinking about &ldquo;what should go in a home page?&rdquo; (of the app!) or what goes into the tabbed navigation. If you&rsquo;re designing around a defined flow or set of common functions, your app will more closely resemble a mobile app than a web site, with a focus on content and functionality over chrome and navigation.<\/li><li>Design for mobile first (even if a mobile app is not in your roadmap). The constraints of a mobile context will force you to focus on what&rsquo;s essential, and help you cut what&rsquo;s not needed. The question &ldquo;How would I design this as a mobile app?&rdquo; always clears my head and helps me find the simpler, elegant solution.<\/li><li>Don&rsquo;t over design. Less is better in the early stages. Launch with too much going on and you won&rsquo;t know which pieces are broken and which are working.<\/li><li><ol class=\"list-letters list-margin\"><li>Focus on the experience, not the product. Assume people won&rsquo;t want to use your product\u2014in fact, they don&rsquo;t! Except for the early adopter\/beta-junkie, most people have existing habits; you&rsquo;re competing against the inertia of existing behaviors.<\/li><li>Design for the existing ecosystem. People already have apps they know and use. Rather than try to displace those, can you work with these other systems? <\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Reject any design candidate who is overly focused on process. UXers accustomed to corporate environments may want to &ldquo;do it the right way&rdquo; (there is no right way). Aside from initial research, most startups can&rsquo;t afford (or shouldn&rsquo;t be spending money on) too many deliverables or things that don&rsquo;t directly translate into product improvements. Iterate early and often. Don&rsquo;t focus too much on documentation.<\/li><li><ol class=\"list-letters list-margin\"><li>You get what you pay for. I charge a lot. But, I guarantee you&rsquo;ll save money in the long run. Most visual designers at 1\/4 my rate will take much longer and still not get you where a seasoned veteran will. Note: veteran doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean years experience\u20142 years at a dot com startup taught me more than most people learn in 5\u20137 years at a big company.<\/li><li>As a corollary to the above comment: experience and na\u00efvet\u00e9 are good things. You get a fresh perspective not indoctrinated with jargon or groupthink.<\/li><\/ol><\/li><li>Designs are never handed off. Design isn&rsquo;t a stage\u2014it&rsquo;s always happening with every new release. Think long term.<\/li><li>Hire &ldquo;experts&rdquo; initially. Transition to mid or jr. level folks over time, as the problems get more defined. Keep the expert around to offer guidance and mentor these less experienced folks. This, by the way, is the approach I use with my startup clients.<\/li><li>Work together! Don&rsquo;t think about handoffs, think about collaboration. Where there are too many meetings or an abundance of documentation, I&rsquo;ve also seen a proportionate lack of communication and lack of clear alignment amongst the team.<\/li><li>Frame the problems to be to be solved, then evaluate accordingly. Set aside your subjective opinions. Evaluate the design based on how well is satisfies (or delights) the end user.<\/li><li>Good designers will question assumptions\u2014and will very likely ask you to undo stuff that&rsquo;s already been done. This is a good thing. Mostly.<\/li><li>Good design doesn&rsquo;t happen magically: there needs to be: (1) a well articulated\u2013and shared\u2013vision, and (2) autonomy. Making sense of a really, really hard problem requires uninterrupted time where you can &ldquo;go deep&rdquo; with a problem (8 1-hour blocks of time do not equal 1 8-hour block of time!).<\/li><li>If possible, build your API, then build your app on top of this. This leaves room for a lot more flexibility, both in terms of what you can do in the UI and portability to other devices.<\/li><li>Please, please, please spend time hanging out in the latest and greatest apps, regardless of their personal relevance or interest to you. If you do, your expectations of a &ldquo;good experience&rdquo; will be raised. Archaic team communication tools are often a good indication of what the decision makers believe qualifies as &ldquo;good.&rdquo; (Hint: it&rsquo;s often a very low bar relative to what&rsquo;s possible!) <\/li><li>Unless you&rsquo;re doing something entirely new or different, think about the Minimum Viable Experience. MVP tends to focus on features and functionality. In a crowded, mature space, HOW you implement something is equally\u2014or more\u2014important than WHAT you implement.<\/li><li>What should you look for most of all in a designer? Curiosity, Empathy, and Grit. I&rsquo;d care far more about these traits than any artifacts or prior &ldquo;design&rdquo; experience.<\/li><li>Get to know each other outside of the work environment\u2014as friends.

They are not the same. And while there\nis (and should be) a lot of overlap in skills\u2014it\u2019s good to know what the designer you\u2019re hiring\nthinks is priority.\n\n *  Recognizing these differences, know that a pretty coat of paint will not make your very real usability\nproblems magically disappear. I\u2019ve said as much in conversations: \u201cSo, to be clear, you\u2019re\njust looking for a shiny coat of paint right now, and you\u2019re not interested in fixing the problems that\nare going to stop people in their tracks\u2026?!\u201d \n\n *  Form labels, microcopy, instructional text\u2014this is core to an application. In fact, the best UIs often\nstart as written conversations between the user and the system. Be wary of designers who layer copy into their\nlovely layouts, or worse, use \u201clorem ipsum\u201d as a stand-in for functional copy; these are signs\nyou\u2019ve hired a stylist and not a designer. (The same is true of visualizations\u2014good designers start\nwith the data, not the pretty pictures!)\n\n *  Don\u2019t look at a design or prototype as an approximation for what should be implemented. A good\ndesigner will sweat every detail. A 20px size difference, a change in the typeface, the timing of an\nanimation\u2014these kinds of things make the difference between confusion and delight.\n\n *  \n\n *  Bring in the UX designer before you\u2019ve attempted any UI work. I can\u2019t tell you how many times\nmy clients have said \u201cI wish I\u2019d brought you in earlier!\u201d The UI changes are often enough to\nnecessitate technical re-architecture. Starting with a good designer from day one will save you a lot of\nheadaches later on\u2026\n\n *  Of course, starting with an existing alpha version means requirements have been defined. In these cases a\ngood designer can spend her time redefining how things get done in the UI (however, be wary of\n\u201cfunctional fixedness;\u201d I spend a lot of my time just getting everyone on the team\u2014designers\nincluded\u2014to see the problem in a different way, not the way it has been implemented).\n\n *  Listen for what your customer needs, not what they ask for. Good design (or UX) isn\u2019t about giving\ncustomers everything they request\u2014it\u2019s about listening to these needs and then showing the thing they\ncan\u2019t articulate (unless they also have a good design sense!).\n\n *  Iterate on a weekly or bi-weekly basis with real customers and users. Do not skip or marginalize this\ncritical feedback loop. If you do, you risk building a product that no one else really cares about using.\n\n *  Iterate with 5\u20137 different customers who have very different needs. If you design for a homogenous group\nof folks, you\u2019ll end up with the perfect system for a small minority; your system likely won\u2019t\nscale to accommodate the needs of a market. By testing with a diverse group of customers, you rise above\nspecifics to see the patterns and common challenges. You create a product that addresses a market need.\n\n *  Make sure your problem space is well researched and that you\u2019re beginning with customer input, not\nwaiting for it later on (when it\u2019s too late to make significant changes).\n\n *  Hire a dedicated front-end developer. Don\u2019t let your UI be the afterthought of back-end programming.\nThere\u2019s too much going on in the UI to rely on libraries and frameworks. If you\u2019re doing anything\nat all unconventional, you\u2019ll need a good front-end dev to build these out. Better yet, pair this\nfront-end dev with the designer so they can create and iterate together on functional prototypes. Then, once\nthese designs have been vetted with customers, there\u2019s no documentation needed for styles or behaviors,\nor miscommunication in the dreaded \u201chandoff\u201d\u2014that stuff is already taken care of. The UI is\nready to be hooked up to the back-end systems.\n\n *  Good designers will care about your technology stack, to the extent that it affects the UI.\n\n *  Design from the \u201cbottom up\u201d (vs \u201ctop down\u201d). What do I mean by this? In web apps,\nthe structure of your app (IA) will emerge over time\u2014don\u2019t start with structure or navigation. Think\nabout flows, scenarios, and activities. The structure of the site will emerge from specific page level\ndesigns. Start with a laser focus on a specific activity, then follow that thread into other areas of the app.\nStarting with a top down focus on structure and consistent UI elements often glosses over the details and\nminutiae that set apart a stellar product. And don\u2019t get hung up on inconsistent interaction and visual\ndetails that come about from this bottom up focus\u2014these details will be ironed out as time goes on. That\nsaid, if you start with a comprehensive UI framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation, this will help a\ndesigner be intentional about introducing inconsistencies. Not that I\u2019m admitting a personal flaw of\nmine or anything.\n\n *  Don\u2019t force web site patterns on a web app. For example, don\u2019t waste your time thinking about\n\u201cwhat should go in a home page?\u201d (of the app!) or what goes into the tabbed navigation. If\nyou\u2019re designing around a defined flow or set of common functions, your app will more closely resemble a\nmobile app than a web site, with a focus on content and functionality over chrome and navigation.\n\n *  Design for mobile first (even if a mobile app is not in your roadmap). The constraints of a mobile context\nwill force you to focus on what\u2019s essential, and help you cut what\u2019s not needed. The question\n\u201cHow would I design this as a mobile app?\u201d always clears my head and helps me find the simpler,\nelegant solution.\n\n *  Don\u2019t over design. Less is better in the early stages. Launch with too much going on and you\nwon\u2019t know which pieces are broken and which are working.\n\n *  \n\n *  Focus on the experience, not the product. Assume people won\u2019t want to use your product\u2014in fact,\nthey don\u2019t! Except for the early adopter\/beta-junkie, most people have existing habits; you\u2019re\ncompeting against the inertia of existing behaviors.\n\n *  Design for the existing ecosystem. People already have apps they know and use. Rather than try to displace\nthose, can you work with these other systems? \n\n *  Reject any design candidate who is overly focused on process. UXers accustomed to corporate environments\nmay want to \u201cdo it the right way\u201d (there is no right way). Aside from initial research, most\nstartups can\u2019t afford (or shouldn\u2019t be spending money on) too many deliverables or things that\ndon\u2019t directly translate into product improvements. Iterate early and often. Don\u2019t focus too much\non documentation.\n\n *  \n\n *  You get what you pay for. I charge a lot. But, I guarantee you\u2019ll save money in the long run. Most\nvisual designers at 1\/4 my rate will take much longer and still not get you where a seasoned veteran will.\nNote: veteran doesn\u2019t necessarily mean years experience\u20142 years at a dot com startup taught me more\nthan most people learn in 5\u20137 years at a big company.\n\n *  As a corollary to the above comment: experience and na\u00efvet\u00e9 are good things. You get a fresh perspective\nnot indoctrinated with jargon or groupthink.\n\n *  Designs are never handed off. Design isn\u2019t a stage\u2014it\u2019s always happening with every new\nrelease. Think long term.\n\n *  Hire \u201cexperts\u201d initially. Transition to mid or jr. level folks over time, as the problems get\nmore defined. Keep the expert around to offer guidance and mentor these less experienced folks. This, by the\nway, is the approach I use with my startup clients.\n\n *  Work together! Don\u2019t think about handoffs, think about collaboration. Where there are too many\nmeetings or an abundance of documentation, I\u2019ve also seen a proportionate lack of communication and lack\nof clear alignment amongst the team.\n\n *  Frame the problems to be to be solved, then evaluate accordingly. Set aside your subjective opinions.\nEvaluate the design based on how well is satisfies (or delights) the end user.\n\n *  Good designers will question assumptions\u2014and will very likely ask you to undo stuff that\u2019s already\nbeen done. This is a good thing. Mostly.\n\n *  Good design doesn\u2019t happen magically: there needs to be: (1) a well articulated\u2013and\nshared\u2013vision, and (2) autonomy. Making sense of a really, really hard problem requires uninterrupted time\nwhere you can \u201cgo deep\u201d with a problem (8 1-hour blocks of time do not equal 1 8-hour block of\ntime!).\n\n *  If possible, build your API, then build your app on top of this. This leaves room for a lot more\nflexibility, both in terms of what you can do in the UI and portability to other devices.\n\n *  Please, please, please spend time hanging out in the latest and greatest apps, regardless of their\npersonal relevance or interest to you. If you do, your expectations of a \u201cgood experience\u201d will be\nraised. Archaic team communication tools are often a good indication of what the decision makers believe\nqualifies as \u201cgood.\u201d (Hint: it\u2019s often a very low bar relative to what\u2019s possible!)\n\n\n *  Unless you\u2019re doing something entirely new or different, think about the Minimum Viable Experience.\nMVP tends to focus on features and functionality. In a crowded, mature space, HOW you implement something is\nequally\u2014or more\u2014important than WHAT you implement.\n\n *  What should you look for most of all in a designer? Curiosity, Empathy, and Grit. I\u2019d care far more\nabout these traits than any artifacts or prior \u201cdesign\u201d experience.\n\n *  Get to know each other outside of the work environment\u2014as friends.

It is a huge part of my freelance business. In fact, it&rsquo;s probably more important than any other thing I do for my clients and projects (and sanity).<\/p><p>At any given point, I usually have at least two client projects I&rsquo;m working on. Combine that with my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; projects and just running a business, there seem to be a million details I need to keep track of every day. While I&rsquo;m a naturally organized person (with a freakish passion for to-do lists), strategic project management is the only way I&rsquo;ve found to ensure that <em>everything<\/em> gets done on time and to the best of my ability.<\/p><p>I think that at least 50% of effective project management is tied to the person, and their internal ability to organize, collaborate and communicate. Some folks just inherently make great project managers, and some don&rsquo;t. But that other half of project management, depends on tools. During my almost&ndash;two&ndash;years of being self-employed, I&rsquo;ve found some great ones that I simply could not live without to manage the projects in my life.<\/p><h1>Basecamp<\/h1><p>I use <a href=\"http:\/\/basecamp.com\/\">Basecamp<\/a> for all of my client projects, as well as for running my business. The standard features of messages, to-do lists, calendar and files are great. My clients appreciate having the big picture view of a project, while I couldn&rsquo;t live without the small picture view Basecamp provides.<\/p><p>But what I really love about Basecamp are templates for to-do lists and projects. Each client project has many of the same tasks and milestones as other projects. Rather than creating a project from scratch each time, I have a handful of project templates that I use to get started. One, for example, is setup with milestones, messages and to-dos relevant to an ExpressionEngine build.<\/p><p>When I start a new <abbr title=\"ExpressionEngine\">EE<\/abbr> project, I use that project template and in less than a minute, I have all of the core to-dos and milestones in place. The project template also includes the introductory messages I send to the client. It only takes about 10-15 additional minutes to add to-dos and milestones that are unique to the project.<\/p><p>For repetitive tasks that involve several steps to complete, I rely on to-do list templates. For example, when I ran Webquerque, every month we had an event. There was a ton of work involved to bring an event to life, but it was always the same tasks every time: pre-event promotion, venue coordination, A\/V equipment prep, etc., etc. So each time I began work on a new event, I would use to do list templates to get my lists for that event ready &hellip; in about five minutes.<\/p><p>Aside from all the time I save, these templates are invaluable for me to keep track of details and nuances. Whenever I realize I&rsquo;m missing a step in a process, or even if I find areas I can trim, I update the templates and they are ready for my next project. I don&rsquo;t have to think. I know the templates represent my current process with all of the detail necessary.<\/p><h1>FreshBooks<\/h1><p>For time tracking, billing and expense management, I use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">FreshBooks<\/a>. It&rsquo;s not too much different than some of the other online billing management tools like FreeAgent and Harvest. But it has just the right features for me.<\/p><p>The dashboard is solid, giving me high-level views of paid\/unpaid invoices, expenses and hours. The time tracking is simple, and I love that my clients can see hours logged on their project whenever they want. FreshBooks also handles invoices in a way that allows me to selectively charge Gross Receipts Tax for my in-state clients (thank you New Mexico Taxation &amp; Revenue), but not my out&ndash;of&ndash;state clients.<\/p><p>In addition to managing my time and money, FreshBooks has been invaluable in helping me assess my project budgets for hours, which has led to much more accurate estimating.<\/p><p>And my last favorite thing about FreshBooks is the ability to set up recurring expenses, such as rent, internet and the monthly fees for services like Basecamp and FreshBooks.<\/p><h1>Shoeboxed<\/h1><p>I use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shoeboxed.com\/\">Shoeboxed<\/a> for expenses that have paper receipts. It is a unique service: You mail in receipts, Shoeboxed scans them, enters the amount and payee, and even categorizes the receipt using tax categories. Prior to Shoeboxed, I did all of this manually and it took forever. Just scanning my receipts so that I could keep digital copies is hours upon hours of work. But I also had a (bad) habit of leaving my receipts and expenses until the end of the year, so getting my tax information ready took me days. It was miserable.<\/p><p>Now, I&rsquo;ve totally got my expense management under control. I mail my paper receipts in to Shoeboxed each month. Once they are posted, I review and make sure everything is correct. Then I export the expenses for the month from Shoeboxed, and import them into FreshBooks which gives me the big picture view of my expenses in relation to income.<\/p><p>That&rsquo;s it. Takes about 30 minutes a month, probably less. And I&rsquo;m 100% ready come tax time.<\/p><h1>Gmail<\/h1><p>The last service I couldn&rsquo;t live without is Gmail. It is my one and only email client, and I manage all of my various email addresses and inboxes with it.

Combine that with my &ldquo;personal&rdquo; projects and just running a business, there seem to be a million details I need to keep track of every day. While I&rsquo;m a naturally organized person (with a freakish passion for to-do lists), strategic project management is the only way I&rsquo;ve found to ensure that <em>everything<\/em> gets done on time and to the best of my ability.<\/p><p>I think that at least 50% of effective project management is tied to the person, and their internal ability to organize, collaborate and communicate. Some folks just inherently make great project managers, and some don&rsquo;t. But that other half of project management, depends on tools. During my almost&ndash;two&ndash;years of being self-employed, I&rsquo;ve found some great ones that I simply could not live without to manage the projects in my life.<\/p><h1>Basecamp<\/h1><p>I use <a href=\"http:\/\/basecamp.com\/\">Basecamp<\/a> for all of my client projects, as well as for running my business. The standard features of messages, to-do lists, calendar and files are great. My clients appreciate having the big picture view of a project, while I couldn&rsquo;t live without the small picture view Basecamp provides.<\/p><p>But what I really love about Basecamp are templates for to-do lists and projects. Each client project has many of the same tasks and milestones as other projects. Rather than creating a project from scratch each time, I have a handful of project templates that I use to get started. One, for example, is setup with milestones, messages and to-dos relevant to an ExpressionEngine build.<\/p><p>When I start a new <abbr title=\"ExpressionEngine\">EE<\/abbr> project, I use that project template and in less than a minute, I have all of the core to-dos and milestones in place. The project template also includes the introductory messages I send to the client. It only takes about 10-15 additional minutes to add to-dos and milestones that are unique to the project.<\/p><p>For repetitive tasks that involve several steps to complete, I rely on to-do list templates. For example, when I ran Webquerque, every month we had an event. There was a ton of work involved to bring an event to life, but it was always the same tasks every time: pre-event promotion, venue coordination, A\/V equipment prep, etc., etc. So each time I began work on a new event, I would use to do list templates to get my lists for that event ready &hellip; in about five minutes.<\/p><p>Aside from all the time I save, these templates are invaluable for me to keep track of details and nuances. Whenever I realize I&rsquo;m missing a step in a process, or even if I find areas I can trim, I update the templates and they are ready for my next project. I don&rsquo;t have to think. I know the templates represent my current process with all of the detail necessary.<\/p><h1>FreshBooks<\/h1><p>For time tracking, billing and expense management, I use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/\">FreshBooks<\/a>. It&rsquo;s not too much different than some of the other online billing management tools like FreeAgent and Harvest. But it has just the right features for me.<\/p><p>The dashboard is solid, giving me high-level views of paid\/unpaid invoices, expenses and hours. The time tracking is simple, and I love that my clients can see hours logged on their project whenever they want. FreshBooks also handles invoices in a way that allows me to selectively charge Gross Receipts Tax for my in-state clients (thank you New Mexico Taxation &amp; Revenue), but not my out&ndash;of&ndash;state clients.<\/p><p>In addition to managing my time and money, FreshBooks has been invaluable in helping me assess my project budgets for hours, which has led to much more accurate estimating.<\/p><p>And my last favorite thing about FreshBooks is the ability to set up recurring expenses, such as rent, internet and the monthly fees for services like Basecamp and FreshBooks.<\/p><h1>Shoeboxed<\/h1><p>I use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shoeboxed.com\/\">Shoeboxed<\/a> for expenses that have paper receipts. It is a unique service: You mail in receipts, Shoeboxed scans them, enters the amount and payee, and even categorizes the receipt using tax categories. Prior to Shoeboxed, I did all of this manually and it took forever. Just scanning my receipts so that I could keep digital copies is hours upon hours of work. But I also had a (bad) habit of leaving my receipts and expenses until the end of the year, so getting my tax information ready took me days. It was miserable.<\/p><p>Now, I&rsquo;ve totally got my expense management under control. I mail my paper receipts in to Shoeboxed each month. Once they are posted, I review and make sure everything is correct. Then I export the expenses for the month from Shoeboxed, and import them into FreshBooks which gives me the big picture view of my expenses in relation to income.<\/p><p>That&rsquo;s it.

And it isn&rsquo;t standardisation.<\/p>","thought_markdown":"\n\n# On standards and sausages\n\nIn any industry, standards are vital, and the Web industry is no different.\n\nAfter the dark days of the browser Wars, in which Microsoft and Netscape competed on adding ever more\nproprietary whizz-bangs to lock developers in \u2013 ahem, more deeply engage developers into their eco-systems,\nI mean \u2013 we\u2019re in an age when all browser and tool vendors compete to tell you how great their\nstandards support is. And this is A Good Thing\u2122.\n\nAs [Bismarck never said](http:\/\/en.wikiquote.org\/wiki\/Otto_von_Bismarck#Misattributed) \u201cLaws are like\nsausages. You should never see them being made\u201d and the same is true of standards. There are many ways\nto make a standard \u2013 some more palatable than others.\n\nSome things are defacto standards \u2013 GIF, JPG, webM, h264. Others, like JavaScript (more accurately,\nECMAscript) are made by a committee in a smoky room \u2013 in the case of ECMAscript, a group with the sinister\nname of [TC39](http:\/\/www.ecma-international.org\/memento\/TC39.htm).\n\nOthers are retrospectively standardised at the end of their evolution from proprietary whizzbang to defacto\nstandard to real standard. Examples of this are some of Microsoft\u2019s best gifts to the Web:\nXMLHttpRequest (XHR) which powers almost all Ajax-driven sites, innerHTML and contentEditable.\n\nAnother example, this time from Apple, is <canvas> \u2013 invented for Apple\u2019s dashboard widgets,\nliked by everyone and so reverse-engineered and improved by Mozilla, reverse-engineered and implemented by\nOpera, reverse-engineered and specified by Ian Hickson as part of the HTML5 effort. When Microsoft wanted to\nimplement it, they didn\u2019t have to waste hundreds or thousands of man-hours reverse engineering, with its\nstupid waste of time and potential to introduce interoperability-damaging bugs: they just picked up the spec\nand implemented what it said.\n\nBut as the editor of HTML5, [Ian Hickson](http:\/\/ln.hixie.ch\/?start=1089635050&count=1), said of\n<canvas>, \u201cThe real solution is to bring these proposals to the table, get some consensus between\nthe relevant vendors and other interested parties, and then use that.\u201d\n\nThe best kind of standards process involves as many competitor stakeholders as possible going completely\ncrazy:\n\n *  sharing ideas\n\n *  trying out ideas in their own labs and sharing results\n\n *  discussing openly\n\n *  compromising where necessary to achieve concensus\n\n *  implementing what has been specified.\n\nThis is how the HTML5 effort has worked. Anne van Kesteren [described\nit](http:\/\/annevankesteren.nl\/2012\/07\/passion):\n\n> We developed HTML in the open, taking\n> input from anyone, and pretty much from anywhere (mostly tracking blogs back in the day). Until that point\n> HTML was by and large developed by a committee in private meetings.\n\nBut the collegiate, co-operative, *productive* working environment that bloomed so encouragingly seems to be\nwithering.\n\nMore and more, we see different companies seeking to solve similar problems secretly, and without discussion.\nThis is why we have many formats for [packaged\/installable Web\napplications](http:\/\/www.brucelawson.co.uk\/2011\/installable-web-apps-and-interoperability\/). Of course, each\ncompany promises that it will *eventually* standardise its solution to the problem, leading to [a\nproliferation of \u201cstandards\u201d](http:\/\/xkcd.com\/927\/).\n\nTrying stuff out (perhaps with vendor prefixes) and reporting back is a vital part if standardisation. But\npresenting whole new features as a fait accompli, and encouraging their use by developers on the open Web\nloses discussion, the sharing of ideas and results from the process. The end-result loses ease for developers\nand, ultimately, interoperability for consumers \u2013 you know, the great unwashed that we actually make\nWebsites for.\n\nTossing a specification that you\u2019ve written in-house, in secret and already implemented onto a table at\nW3C, saying \u201chere, standardise this\u201d as you saunter past isn\u2019t a Get Out of Jail Free card\nfor proprietary misdemeanours.

From being out and in that life, engaging with it, being\ninterested in it, exploring things that have absolutely no relevance to our work or the problem space\nwe\u2019re exploring.\n\nThe author says:\n\n> Every good creative person in advertising whom I have ever known has\n> always had two noticeable characteristics. First, there was no subject under the sun in which he could not\n> easily get interested\u2014from, say, Egyptian burial customs to modern art. Every facet of life had fascination\n> for him. Second, he was an extensive browser in all sorts of fields of information. For it is with the\n> advertising man as with the cow, no browsing, no milk.\n\nMake it your mission this summer (and beyond) to get out into the world and to browse widely and interestedly\nin things that you\u2019ve never paid attention to before. That have nothing to do with the internet, with\nyour profession. Fill your mind with diverse experiences and engage with them fully.\n\nAnd don\u2019t try to turn these new experiences into solutions or creative ideas on the fly. Let them\nsettle. When describing the \u2018mental digestive process\u2019 James Webb Young also confirms that time\nnot thinking about the problem is essential. He advises that we \u2018drop the entire subject and put the\nidea out of your mind as completely as possible\u2019, to \u2018turn the problem over to your unconscious\nmind and let it work while you sleep.\u2019 \n\nAlmost always the best solutions to complicated problems come to us when we\u2019re away from our desk.\nSometimes in the middle of the night, sometimes in the shower, sometimes midway through a run. \n\nWe need to be more disciplined about giving problems a proper diet of new and diverse experience, and then\ngiving them space to roll over in our mind, to find new combinations and for interesting ideas to emerge. \n\nWe need to be more disciplined about giving ourselves a break. \n\nSo, get started this summer\u2014step away from your desk, go out and indulge in the rest of life and know that,\nas you do it, you\u2019re also making yourself better at your work. And enjoy yourself while you let your\nunconscious mind do its thing.\n\n*(With apologies to Southern Hemisphere readers and those in the UK assuming the weather will have turned bad\nagain by the time this is published)*","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @leisa on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/leisa-reichelt\/28-07-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Leisa Reichelt","slug":"leisa-reichelt","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/leisa-reichelt\/2012-july-28","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000010561639\/d59a15b77a6c8251316091c362618b74_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1343376000","date":"2012-july-27","nicedate":"Friday, 27 July 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>The best systems are built by people who can accept that no-one will ever know how hard it was to do, and who therefore don&#8217;t seek validation by explaining to everyone how hard it was to do.<\/p>","thought_raw":"<p>The best systems are built by people who can accept that no-one will ever know how hard it was to do, and who therefore don&#8217;t seek validation by explaining to everyone how hard it was to do.<\/p>","thought_markdown":"\n\nThe best systems are built by people who can accept that no-one will ever know how hard it was to do, and who\ntherefore don\u2019t seek validation by explaining to everyone how hard it was to do.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @sil on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/stuart-langridge\/27-07-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Stuart Langridge","slug":"stuart-langridge","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/stuart-langridge\/2012-july-27","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/55108762\/hackergotchi-simpler_bigger.png"},{"pubdate":"1343289600","date":"2012-july-26","nicedate":"Thursday, 26 July 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>Music has been an important part of my life since my teenage years; first as a listener, then as a creator (a hobby I still entertain for a few weeks a year), and then as an insider within the music industry: my first &lsquo;proper&rsquo; job was Junior Designer for EMI Records and after two years with the company I moved to indie label Sanctuary Records, again as an in-house web designer.

Karl Fast says it best: \u201cthe problem space is\nnow partly in the head and partly in the world, with interaction linking and blending these two spaces\ntogether.\u201d By interacting with this external representation we have the potential to learn more deeply\nand to see more options, as with the chess player evaluating possible outcomes. This is partly why I favor\ninteractive visualization. But what happens when interactions involve far more than a simple mouse click or\ntap of the finger? What happens when communication, movement, motion, position and other forms of interaction\nbecome part of the designers toolbox? That, for me, is a thrilling future. New forms of interaction helping us\nmake sense of the world around us\u2026 CRUD tools, and to be fair, tools for sorting, filtering and searching\ncontent, are going to seem crude when compared to whatever comes next!

Of course assembling the deck and talking points\nreinforces my knowledge, but it\u2019s the attendees who teach me the most. After presentations, I always get\ngreat questions from attendees, and I particularly love the ones I can't answer. These give me a broader\nperspective of my topic, as well as a reason to learn more about the subject for next time.\n\nAll of this, plus my client work, means I\u2019m ridiculously busy most of the time. Yet, for me, it is worth\nit on so many levels. Writing, podcasting and presenting has helped me build my reputation and are, basically,\nmy main avenues for marketing myself. Sometimes I even get paid for it (woo!). But most of all, I pursue these\nendeavors as a means to satisfy my personal desire to learn and to do my job better and faster.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @emilylewis on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/emily-lewis\/25-06-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Emily Lewis","slug":"emily-lewis","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/emily-lewis\/2012-june-25","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1886668786\/Short_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1340524800","date":"2012-june-24","nicedate":"Sunday, 24 June 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>I recently was able to see Douglas Crockford speak.

How many times have you been in a conversation with someone who says something like &#8220;It&#8217;s alright for you, you can do what you want when you want!&#8221;<\/p><p>For the most part they are right, it&#8217;s great working from your favourite coffee shop or on a train whilst you are travelling in the middle of the day to see a friend.

My commute is literally seconds so I have put things in place to help. For example every day I get out of the house to take my children to school. It&#8217;s a great start to the day, unless it&#8217;s raining, and an opportunity to get some time to think. Additionally I decided to take all public holidays as holidays (something I haven&#8217;t always done).<\/p><p>So what&#8217;s the point of me telling you all this? Well it struck me the other day that I really don&#8217;t know how to take a &#8220;day off&#8221;\u2014remember those? A day to yourself, not a public holiday or a weekend, a day that you mark off in your calendar just for you. I had hoped to book in one or two a quarter but so far it hasn&#8217;t happened.

Understand yourself better, and understand others as\nmuch as you can.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @leisa on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/leisa-reichelt\/25-05-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Leisa Reichelt","slug":"leisa-reichelt","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/leisa-reichelt\/2012-may-25","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000010561639\/d59a15b77a6c8251316091c362618b74_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1337846400","date":"2012-may-24","nicedate":"Thursday, 24 May 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>I recently did a Q&amp;A for <cite>.net magazine<\/cite> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.netmagazine.com\/shop\">June 2012, issue 228<\/a>), answering a few reader questions.

There's hardly a straight answer for \"What\nshould I charge?\" It depends on many factors: the value of the project to your client, the amount of inquiries\nyou currently have, the type of project, who the client is, the services needed, the amount of time necessary\nto complete the project, the amount of time you have available, and many more.\n\nFor even the greenest of designers, gut reaction is often disregarded for logic, to their own detriment. Trust\nyour gut; it can tell you many things that a spreadsheet cannot.\n\nHere's a system I use to help qualify my gut reaction. Ask yourself what object you would barter for this\nproject. Let's choose a website redesign as an example, a type of project many likely get. Choose an object to\nrepresent the value of your project. If your client offered you a new iPod touch instead of cash, would that\nbe fair to you? Probably (hopefully) not, which means you value this project at a higher rate than $199\n(currently the going price for an iPod touch). What about a Playstation 3? An iPad 2? Dinner at your choice of\n3-star Michelin restaurants? A Canon EOS 5D Mark III?\u00a0\u00a0A week-long all expense paid trip to the\nresort of your choice?\u00a0Rent for a year?\u00a0A new Volkswagen Touareg?\n\nLet's say you thought the Canon EOS 5D Mark III was a fair trade for this website design. Since the current\nprice for that camera is about $3500, that gives you a good sense of the minimum you would charge for this\nproject. While I certainly don't suggest making this the\u00a0*only*\u00a0way that you evaluate value, it can\ndefinitely help you to hone in that gut reaction to get a sense of where you really place the value of your\nproject.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about how to price a project, check out these excellent resources:\n\n *  [Why we are getting rid of our hourly\nrate](http:\/\/www.teehanlax.com\/blog\/why-we-are-getting-rid-of-our-hourly-rate\/), by Teehan+Lax\n\n *  [Pricing Strategy for Creatives](http:\/\/www.alistapart.com\/articles\/pricing-strategy-for-creatives\/), by\nJason Blumer\n\n *  [The Dark Art of\nPricing](http:\/\/www.jessicahische.is\/obsessedwiththeinternet\/andhelpingyougetpaid\/the-dark-art-of-pricing), by\nJessica Hische\n\n *  [The 'Hows' of Pricing Your Design\nWork](http:\/\/www.thedesigncubicle.com\/2009\/07\/the-hows-of-pricing-your-design-work\/), by Brian Hoff\n\n *  [How much to charge for design\nwork?](http:\/\/justcreative.com\/2009\/02\/26\/how-much-to-charge-for-design-work\/)\u00a0by JUST\u2122 Creative\n\n *  [Designers' Hourly Rates: Are You Charging\nEnough](http:\/\/www.howdesign.com\/design-business\/pricing\/hourly-rates\/), by HOW Design\n\n *  [Tiered value-based pricing](http:\/\/www.teehanlax.com\/blog\/tiered-value-based-pricing\/), by\nTeehan+Lax","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @danielmall on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/dan-mall\/05-05-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Dan Mall","slug":"dan-mall","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/dan-mall\/2012-may-5","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2668936560\/e556169271e5f9267e28d0ac66dea3dd_bigger.png"},{"pubdate":"1336118400","date":"2012-may-4","nicedate":"Friday, 4 May 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>Plugins are one of the main reasons I enjoy using WordPress.

But the truth of it was, I was letting my ego drive. And my ego wasn't interested in\nconsidering anything external. Because that's how egos are.\n\nEgos don't care about requirements, timelines, budgets, user needs, limited resources or legacy systems. They\ndon't care about other opinions or ideas. They are roadblocks to everything essential to making a project\nsuccessful,\u00a0especially\u00a0compromise, collaboration and communication.\u00a0And, worst of all, ego\nkeeps\u00a0*you*\u00a0from growing.\u00a0Your ego won't let you learn something new. Or see a different\nperspective. Or even get inspired.\n\nKnowing this is so much easier than\u00a0*doing*\u00a0something about it, though. It can be hard to\ndistinguish your ego from your opinion (or passion or\u00a0commitment). But it's just as important to hone\nthat skill as it is to keep up with changing technologies, because employers want someone with a point of view\nwho is open to other points of view. Clients want to work with an expert who listens to them and considers\ntheir realities. Colleagues want to work with someone who has great ideas\u00a0*and*\u00a0welcomes others'.\nAll of us want to be inspired, but not if it means tolerating assholery.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to keep ego in check is to\u00a0__take your time__. I've learned to never respond\nimmediately to a change request or a demanding question. Ego is always ready with the first answer, which is\nrarely the most thoughtful one. A little bit of time can make the difference between an ego-driven reply and a\nwell-considered response.\n\nIt also helps to\u00a0__keep your focus on what's important__. For example, if I feel myself getting defensive\nwhen a client wants to change a design, I try to shift my focus back to the client and what he needs and\nwants. This doesn't mean sacrificing my expertise or the project goals. It simply opens me to communication,\nwhich is the gateway to a successful project\u00a0*and*\u00a0a happy client who wants to work with me\nagain.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @emilylewis on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/emily-lewis\/29-04-2012","role":"guest","realname":"Emily Lewis","slug":"emily-lewis","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/emily-lewis\/2012-april-29","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1886668786\/Short_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1335600000","date":"2012-april-28","nicedate":"Saturday, 28 April 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>Attention is finite: you only get so much energy to use each day.

But a metaphor none the less.\n\nAnd while metaphors are useful, they are also dangerous.\n\nBecause we are burdened by this metaphor, when it comes to managing our information across multiple devices,\nwe imagine that this information is on each of these devices. Which it may be. But that's purely an\nimplementation detail.\n\nWhen I play a song on my laptop, does it really matter whether it's *really* stored on a server at Apple, or\nGoogle, or Amazon? Or on a NAS on my local network? Or on my phone?\n\nWhen I open a file to be edited, do I care where it is located?\u00a0\n\nThose are implementation details, for developers to worry about.\n\nYet our mental models of what is happening when we play a song, or edit a document, or watch a youtube Video\non AppleTV are encumbered, burdened with the metaphor of a file as a discrete thing, located somewhere\nspecific.\u00a0\n\nHence our obsession with \"cloud computing\" (as if we ever cared about \"magnetic computing\"). And our obsession\nwith synching. Something which simply should be an implementation detail for developers to concern themselves\nwith not something we as users should have to worry about, or even know about.\n\nWhich is all a roundabout way of saying that our mental models of computing are still essentially rooted in\nthe 1940s and 1950s.\u00a0\n\nThe device I hold in my hand, or which sits on my laptop, or my desk is still a store of data, connected to a\nwhole lot of other such devices, some big, some small.\n\nBut that metaphor has outlived its usefulness.\u00a0\n\nDevices are portals to information, and it really shouldn't matter where that information \"really\" is. Whether\nit's cached locally to my device, or always refreshed from a server, shouldn't matter to our user, or to us as\na user.\n\nWhen I start editing a document, then open that document in another device, I should be seeing the same\ndocument.\u00a0When I start watching a movie on AppleTV, then take my phone to bed to finish watching the movie,\nit should be the same movie.\n\nGmail gets closest to this model, indeed does it quite well. But I think it is a metal model of computing that\nwe should strive for as we design and develop for any connected devices. \u00a0","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @johnallsopp on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/john-allsopp\/01-04-2012","role":"guest","realname":"John Allsopp","slug":"john-allsopp","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/john-allsopp\/2012-april-1","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2242417499\/image_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1333180800","date":"2012-march-31","nicedate":"Saturday, 31 March 2012","title":"","thought":"<p>I\u2019m mourning the passing of IE6.<\/p><p>It\u2019s not that I like IE6 or like coding for it but I\u2019ve spent my whole life learning all those hacks, tricks, tips and other nonsense fixes to beat it into submission.

Once upon a time, companies paid hundreds of dollars per seat to license networking technologies for their PCs. No longer.<\/p><p>I think the commodification of the operating system layer is already well under way (during a 3 or 4 year period which has seen an explosion in new operating systems like iOS, Android, webOS, Bada, as well as the major upgrade of Windows Phone 7, this might seem like a ludicrous thing to say, so first let me outline what I mean by commodification).<\/p><p>With hardware, end user decisions were once often made based on the characteristics of CPUs, busses, motherboards, and the like. This is essentially no longer true. Hardware performance matters, but hardware characteristics simply don't (yes, companies do on occasion try to market their Android phones based on their clock speed, but effectively no one cares.) When users no longer care about the characteristics of a layer of a system, that layer has now been commodified.<\/p><p>So, what would it mean for the OS layer to be commodified? In it's most extreme form, end users would cease to care about the OS as part of their platform choice, which right now would be a ludicrous assertion. At least among affluent people in the \u201cdeveloped\u201d world, a very significant percentage of users choose iPhones, in no small part because of the unique user experience of the OS (there are of course other factors at play, which we'll return to shortly).<\/p><p>But let's turn to the Android platform, the other significant smartphone platform (again, at least in the developed world).<\/p><p>Unlike iOS, Android is a far more fragmented ecosystem, even before we get to the array of OS versions. The Android user experience, unlike the rigidly controlled iOS user experience, is endlessly customized by device manufacturers and carriers, which is the first step toward the commodification of the Android platform, which is ironic, because these customization exist largely because of the commodification of the hardware layer.<\/p><p>Unlike iOS, Android form factors, screen sizes and resolutions vary significantly, from 128px x 128px swatch like devices, to Android big screen TVs.<\/p><p>Amazon's recently launched Kindle Fire, based on Android, but with an entirely reworked user experience effectively heralds the commodification of the Android OS. A vanishingly small number of people will purchase a Kindle Fire because it is an Android based device (and few if any won't purchase one when they would otherwise have because it <strong>is<\/strong> an Android device).<\/p><p>Like power and plumbing, Android (and in time all Operating Systems) will simply become a utility - vital, but largely unnoticed (until those times as with water and electricity that it's suddenly not available).<\/p><p>But I don't think the commodification of IT will end there. It will move further up the stack.<\/p><p>So, what sits above operating systems? Applications. Now, how in blue blazes, where the number of apps on a platform is a key measure of the the health of that ecosystem, and where platform owners work incredibly hard to entice developers to their platforms, could we possibly see the application layer commodified? What might this even mean?<\/p><p>Why would anyone actually build an application if it were just going to be a commodity?<\/p><p>Well, it's already happening. In many cases, an application is simply a means of providing part of a broader service (be that banking, or ordering a pizza for home delivery). These services, these business existed before apps, before smart phones, before the web. Apps (like web sites, and people answering plain old telephones) are simply a small part of the existing business.<\/p><p>Twitter effectively commodified Twitter client apps, by releasing their own free native clients across a wide range of platforms, they severely undermined the market for Twitter client applications. It's Twitter the service that matters.  <\/p><p>Then there are services like Netflix, where the application in many ways <strong>is<\/strong> the service (you order, pay for and consume the service inside the application - which of course glosses over the enormous effort behind the scenes to make, but from the user's perspective, their engagement with the service is their engagement with the app).<\/p><p>But in the case of banks, home delivery, services like NetFlix, the application is already a commodity (while it's important that the user experience doesn't suck, that's part of the broader service design, its the overall service, not the application itself which drives users to choose it).<\/p><p>Of course, this is not always true, particularly in the game category. People play Angry Birds because it is Angry Birds. But even here, games are becoming increasingly less a stand alone product, and more part of a broader service. Angry Birds becomes Angry Birds Rio, tied into, and enabled by not application sales, but a broader entertainment experience.<\/p><p>The rise of game networks, with a continuous stream of new, engaging games is gaming as a service, which threatens to turn gaming itself into a commodity.<\/p><p>So, where is the business opportunity, when everything is turning into a utility? <\/p><p>Hardware, Operating Systems, applications, networks don't exist for their own sake. People use them to get things done. They use them for the outcome, not the process.<\/p><p>So, focus on the outcome, what the user wants to achieve - kill time, get food, communicate, learn something - and provide services which help them do that. You'll build sites and apps that run on browsers and operating systems, and ultimately hardware and networks to do so, but what you're really building is the service. Everything else is (and really always has been) but a means to that end.<\/p>","thought_raw":"<h1>Commodification<\/h1><p>Remember not too long ago, when people cared a lot about what was under the hood of their computer?

The\nManufacturer (Intel versus AMD versus Motorola), the architecture (RISC versus CISC), the size of the L1\nCache, the chip's clock speed, the bus speed, and on and on and on?\n\nSure, a lot of this was folks with too much time on their hands, but it was also the technology press. \"Intel\nInside\" was something folks cared a lot about. Chips had brand names, and billion dollar marketing budgets\n(Intel after all sold not directly to the end user, but to the companies that built the system, but still\nspent hundreds of millions branding and marketing Celerons and Pentiums, and Core Duos and so on).\n\nBut a funny thing happened on the way to the future. People simply stopped caring. Few people know, or could\ncare less about the hardware, chips, memory speed of their tablet or phone (and even their laptop). People\ncertainly care about the *results* of the hardware, particularly battery life and perceived performance, but\nnot the hardware itself, or its intrinsic characteristics.\n\nHardware has been almost entirely commodified.\n\nA particularly strong indication of this is the \"ARM\" chip. Unlike most widely used chip architectures of the\npast (exemplified by Intel's 186 instruction set), ARM chips are licensed and manufactured by a wide array of\ncompanies, rather than purchased wholesale from a single manufacturer.\n\nWell into 2005, with Mac OS computers all powered by PowerPC chips, debates about the real world benefits of\nRISC versus CISC architectures (did you have to look the acronyms up?), and raw CPU speeds measured in clock\nfrequencies, versus measuring processor performance using measures such as Instructions Per Second were\n\"serious\" topics of conversation in the tech press, and among technologists with, as I hinted, a little too\nmuch time on their hands.\n\nIf, as little as half a decade ago you were to have suggested the almost complete commodification of the\nhardware layer of computing, I doubt you would have got too many takers. \n\nI believe this process of commodification is a long term trend, that didn't start with PC hardware, and won't\nstop there.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Internet commodified networking, once the domain of huge companies like Novell. Once upon a\ntime, companies paid hundreds of dollars per seat to license networking technologies for their PCs. No\nlonger.\n\nI think the commodification of the operating system layer is already well under way (during a 3 or 4 year\nperiod which has seen an explosion in new operating systems like iOS, Android, webOS, Bada, as well as the\nmajor upgrade of Windows Phone 7, this might seem like a ludicrous thing to say, so first let me outline what\nI mean by commodification).\n\nWith hardware, end user decisions were once often made based on the characteristics of CPUs, busses,\nmotherboards, and the like. This is essentially no longer true. Hardware performance matters, but hardware\ncharacteristics simply don't (yes, companies do on occasion try to market their Android phones based on their\nclock speed, but effectively no one cares.) When users no longer care about the characteristics of a layer of\na system, that layer has now been commodified.\n\nSo, what would it mean for the OS layer to be commodified? In it's most extreme form, end users would cease to\ncare about the OS as part of their platform choice, which right now would be a ludicrous assertion. At least\namong affluent people in the \u201cdeveloped\u201d world, a very significant percentage of users choose iPhones, in\nno small part because of the unique user experience of the OS (there are of course other factors at play,\nwhich we'll return to shortly).\n\nBut let's turn to the Android platform, the other significant smartphone platform (again, at least in the\ndeveloped world).\n\nUnlike iOS, Android is a far more fragmented ecosystem, even before we get to the array of OS versions. The\nAndroid user experience, unlike the rigidly controlled iOS user experience, is endlessly customized by device\nmanufacturers and carriers, which is the first step toward the commodification of the Android platform, which\nis ironic, because these customization exist largely because of the commodification of the hardware layer.\n\nUnlike iOS, Android form factors, screen sizes and resolutions vary significantly, from 128px x 128px swatch\nlike devices, to Android big screen TVs.\n\nAmazon's recently launched Kindle Fire, based on Android, but with an entirely reworked user experience\neffectively heralds the commodification of the Android OS. A vanishingly small number of people will purchase\na Kindle Fire because it is an Android based device (and few if any won't purchase one when they would\notherwise have because it __is__ an Android device).\n\nLike power and plumbing, Android (and in time all Operating Systems) will simply become a utility - vital, but\nlargely unnoticed (until those times as with water and electricity that it's suddenly not available).\n\nBut I don't think the commodification of IT will end there. It will move further up the stack.\n\nSo, what sits above operating systems? Applications. Now, how in blue blazes, where the number of apps on a\nplatform is a key measure of the the health of that ecosystem, and where platform owners work incredibly hard\nto entice developers to their platforms, could we possibly see the application layer commodified? What might\nthis even mean?\n\nWhy would anyone actually build an application if it were just going to be a commodity?\n\nWell, it's already happening. In many cases, an application is simply a means of providing part of a broader\nservice (be that banking, or ordering a pizza for home delivery). These services, these business existed\nbefore apps, before smart phones, before the web. Apps (like web sites, and people answering plain old\ntelephones) are simply a small part of the existing business.\n\nTwitter effectively commodified Twitter client apps, by releasing their own free native clients across a wide\nrange of platforms, they severely undermined the market for Twitter client applications. It's Twitter the\nservice that matters.  \n\nThen there are services like Netflix, where the application in many ways __is__ the service (you order, pay\nfor and consume the service inside the application - which of course glosses over the enormous effort behind\nthe scenes to make, but from the user's perspective, their engagement with the service is their engagement\nwith the app).\n\nBut in the case of banks, home delivery, services like NetFlix, the application is already a commodity (while\nit's important that the user experience doesn't suck, that's part of the broader service design, its the\noverall service, not the application itself which drives users to choose it).\n\nOf course, this is not always true, particularly in the game category. People play Angry Birds because it is\nAngry Birds. But even here, games are becoming increasingly less a stand alone product, and more part of a\nbroader service. Angry Birds becomes Angry Birds Rio, tied into, and enabled by not application sales, but a\nbroader entertainment experience.\n\nThe rise of game networks, with a continuous stream of new, engaging games is gaming as a service, which\nthreatens to turn gaming itself into a commodity.\n\nSo, where is the business opportunity, when everything is turning into a utility? \n\nHardware, Operating Systems, applications, networks don't exist for their own sake.

Of course, many readers will remember the need for \"web safe\" color when a typical video card and monitor could only calculate 256 colors. With 50 of those reserved for system use, we ended up with a 216 color palette that was considered most consistent across all browsers. I had come from the world of dumb terminals, so I was used to green or amber text on black and it never occurred to me that having to limit a color palette for this new and exciting communication space might feel limiting to some.<\/p><p>Over the next year, I was brutally disavowed of this by my students, who regularly would grouse about the lack of \"real\" color on the Web. Almost as new to the Web as my students, I was struggling for a way to explain this to them that showed that 216 colors was actually a luxury for many people in 1995 - up to and including working Web designers, who often had to limit the palette even more if they were serving users without 256 or more color support. Then one day, I stopped by my office to pick something up, and one of the daytime professors whom I'd not met was there. She jumped up and gave me a hug, expressing great personal warmth and an artist's excitement about the Web. \"Molly,\" she said. \"I feel so free on the Web. I've been working in print design my entire career and Ifinally get to work with more than four colors!\"<\/p><p>Suffice it to say, I had found a positive answer for my students! At the time, her response was very unique.

I racked my brain and disposed of the \"too smart, it would be intimidating\" entries\n(like Bill Gates) and the \"I'm only lunching with you cause you're hot\" entries (like Joseph Gordon Levitt)\nand ended up on someone who I thought I could relate with and learn from, Tina Fey. Tina Fey\/Liz Lemon and I\nshare three important similarities: \n\n *  We were both the first femail directors at our jobs. Her as the head writer of Saturday Night Live, me as\nthe Interactive Development Director at Happy Cog.\n\n *  We both accrue lettuce in our hair as a result of eating at our desks.\n\n *  We both have dated a beeper salesman.\n\nIf you're waiting for the comic relief in which I say only one of these three facts is true, you'll be waiting\na while. I never really put much thought into any of these, as they all really just seem like an integral part\nof life, but recently the first one has been on my mind. After reading about [Virgina\nRometty](http:\/\/www.wired.com\/wiredenterprise\/2011\/10\/virginia-rometty\/) being named CEO of IBM, I got to\nthinking, \"that's awesome!
