This is great\nif your goal is to get something up and running quickly, but it can hide the mechanism underneath.\n\nAs such I worry that people are starting to rely on these abstractions a bit too much, while foregoing the\nfundamental knowledge that underpins them. This is especially true when you need to put in an exception and\ntrawling through hundreds of lines of unused code doesn\u2019t feel quite as \u201cfree\u201d any more. I\u2019m also\nworried about the number of companies settling on a library or framework before they\u2019ve even started\nanalysing the problem. It\u2019s as though they are trying to fit the problem around the tool, rather than the\nother way round.\n\nThe strange thing with responsive design is that it isn\u2019t actually that complicated, especially if you\u2019ve\nbeen paying attention to liquid design, universal design and progressive enhancement over the last few years.\nSure, there are a few annoyances like image sizing that require a bit of help, but a lot of responsive\nframeworks sit somewhere between laziness and overkill. This is one of the reasons we\u2019re very specific about\nwanting to hire folks who are aware of the popular libraries and frameworks, but are able to work framework\nfree.\n\nLike all multi-tools, they promise flexibility but that flexibility often comes with hidden limitations and\nboundaries. So as with their JavaScript predecessors, I expect to see a bit of a backlash against responsive\nframeworks over the coming months.\n\nOn the plus side, I think the industry is getting much better at integrating responsive design into our daily\npractice, and this is having positive effects in other areas. For instance, Clearleft have always been a\nfairly collaborative bunch, but that level of collaboration has steadily risen over the last 3-4 years, as\ncross-functional paring became the norm.\n\nThe other big trend of 2013 has to be \u201cflat design\u201d. We can debate the merits of flat design or whether it\ncounts as a movement indefinitely. However, it\u2019s clear than many designers have eschewed metaphorical\ninterfaces\u2014thanks in part to Apple\u2019s overutilization of skeuomorphism\u2014in order to follow a more\ntypographical heritage. The problem with this approach is that it does away with a lot of useful affordances,\nmaking discovery a lot more problematic. This is where kinetic design comes in.\n\nFor a start, subtle animation is a really efficient way of hinting how an interface works by showing what\u2019s\nhidden, able to accept input or otherwise be interacted with. This is especially useful on small screen\ninterfaces where real estate is tight and the chance of distraction is high. Animation is also a great way of\ncommunicating personality and character by simulating weight, friction or playfulness.\n\nHowever it doesn\u2019t stop there. We recently started experimenting with animation as a way of bringing static\nconcepts to life in prototypes or during product presentations. Considering how simple this tool can be,\nwe\u2019ve found it surprisingly effective. In fact, it\u2019s been so effective I\u2019m kicking myself that we\u2019ve\nnever really explored it before.\n\nAt the moment we\u2019re doing this mostly with CSS\/JavaScript or Keynote, although some of our team have been\nplaying with After Effects and Quartz Composer recently. I suspect animation is going to become a much more\ncommon tool in our toolkit over the next 12 months, as we being to gain competency\u2014if not mastery\u2014of the\nvarious packages.\n\nAs such, I think animation is going to become a much more talked about tool over the coming year, with UX\nagencies starting to adopt it into their daily practice as they did with sketching a number of years back. So\nit\u2019s definitely worth exploring new tools like Quartz Composer, experimenting with existing tools like\nKeynote, and organising training session on traditional tools like After Effects. \n\n[\u2014Andy Budd](http:\/\/www.andybudd.com\/)","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @clearleft on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/clearleft\/07-12-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Clearleft","slug":"clearleft","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/clearleft\/2013-december-7","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3095445591\/319124ce0ef9f288204cdc62d5a95c27_bigger.png"},{"pubdate":"1386316800","date":"2013-december-6","nicedate":"Friday, 6 December 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>Eight times (soon to be <a href=\"http:\/\/aneventapart.com\/event\/san-francisco-2013\">nine<\/a>), I have talked at a conference or meetup.

Friends invite me out, but I turn inward, hunched over my desk trying to will the machine into\naction. I\u2019m not really here though; the machine doesn\u2019t do much without me.\n\nStress manifests like depression for me. I crave exercise, but can\u2019t be bothered to do it. I have to remind\nmyself to eat. Every inch of my body growls in the morning. I hibernate in a full-on bear grump. These are\nsome of the signs. There are others too. In corporate jobs, I hide in the restroom periodically or take a long\nwalk to breathe deeply. Sometimes I cry. That makes it worse. Stress begets stress. And if you\u2019re anything\nlike me, feeling useful and contributing to something bigger can be part of the problem. A little addictive\neven.\n\nI started working at 14, because I needed the money. I\u2019ve been helping companies with their customers each\nyear since then. The holiday rush is a big part of that.

Tussling with language and labels and tasks and concepts allows us to wrap our arms around a problem, wrestle with it, and solve it. Designers and developers hear new perspectives. The whole project is strengthened, and it\u2019s extremely satisfying.<\/p><p>But I couldn\u2019t help but feel like there\u2019s another half to this story about what makes content strategy powerful\u2014a half we don\u2019t talk nearly enough about in our urge to get agile and ship and productize all the things.<\/p><p>It\u2019s not in what we do on any given project, though. It\u2019s in our opportunity to immerse people from far outside our project teams into this always-changing world of web-making.<\/p><h2>The \u201cproject\u201d problem<\/h2><p>As web professionals\u2014not just content strategists, but designers, developers, IAs, what-have-yous\u2014we tend to work on <em>projects<\/em>. Whether we\u2019re external agency types or internal web teams or consultants or pretty much anything else, we parcel out our time and energy into tidy chunks: phases, launches, sprints, versions.<\/p><p>When we do, we set up neat borders between our work and the rest of the organization\u2019s day-to-day operations. We think of <em>maintenance<\/em> and even <em>governance<\/em> as the proper upkeep of our project\u2019s output: a way to keep the product running smoothly. We assume that the control we have over the website during its redesign is the way it will be controlled forever.<\/p><p>Only the web doesn\u2019t really work that way. There\u2019s always a messy middle between the project and the organization\u2014a silty confluence where the waters of one can\u2019t help but merge with the other. The website has to hook into a billion different backend systems. The customer service team uses the same help content as the website. The departments need to contribute content that meets new formats. Products change, priorities change, people in charge change.<\/p><p>The web is too big, too intertwined with anything and everything organizations do, to be neatly confined to a project scope.<\/p><p>And when everything is online, suddenly everyone is a web worker, too\u2014even, or perhaps <em>especially<\/em>, all those nonspecialists whose crappy content we\u2019re so busily trying to fix.<\/p><p>Yet we keep on trying.<\/p><h2>On making<\/h2><p>I started working on the web seriously when I joined an agency in 2007. They didn\u2019t think they were hiring a content strategist, though. They thought they were hiring a web writer\u2014someone to pretty up clients\u2019 crappy old stuff and make it ready for the new (usually already designed and built) website. Someone to type up neat little pages called About Us and Our Approach and the dreaded FAQ. Someone to (elegantly, of course) cram a few keywords into the blurbs the \u201ccreative copywriters\u201d had already produced.<\/p><p>It sounds silly now, this way of thinking about web content. Hell, it felt silly <em>then<\/em>, and it\u2019s why I started pushing for more: more thought going into content, more involvement in the early parts of projects, more emphasis on <em>what we\u2019re trying to say<\/em> and <em>what our users need<\/em>.<\/p><p>But you know what I did a lot of then? Making. I made words. I made sitemaps. I made <em>decisions<\/em>.<\/p><p>It was far from ideal, of course. Our research rarely included users; our design team wasn\u2019t cohesive; our process was less than collaborative. But the making\u2014the getting-in-and-figuring-it-out part\u2014still felt powerful.<\/p><p>At least, it did at first. But every time we\u2019d launch a site filled with some shiny new copy, I knew it was only a matter of time before the friendly features would be replaced by a copy-and-pasted press release announcing news no one cared about, before simple sentences would get run through the corporatese generator, before the pages and pages of third-person, dead-to-the-world dullness would be tacked back up all over the place.<\/p><p>It was only a matter of time before my work withered and wilted.<\/p><h2>On documenting<\/h2><p>I never intended to make documents for a living.

However, I\u2019d like to ignore that and approach getting a job from the other end: what are employers looking for? Let\u2019s generalize! <\/p><h2>Think like your future boss<\/h2><p>What is your future boss looking for in an employee? We can break this down into three broad categories: <\/p><p><strong>Hard skills<\/strong> are the ones we generally focus on \u2014 whether you can write clean code, or design a sweet interface. An expert can generally gauge this by looking at your previous work, and discussing the thinking that went into it with you (this second part is key). Even at first glance average work can be worthwhile <em>if you can explain the thinking (and requirements) behind it<\/em>, so be able to show your working. Qualifications are generally not so important, so don\u2019t worry if you lack them (most of us do). <\/p><p><strong>Soft skills<\/strong> include things most of us haven\u2019t thought about since high school career advice class, but these are also essential, and harder for a potential employer to assess. These include things like:<\/p><ul><li><em>Communication skills:<\/em> The ability to listen, communicate clearly what you\u2019re doing and why, and speak &amp; write (at least) passably \u2190 not doing so can look sloppy, so work on this if you know you need to.<\/li><li><em>Dedication:<\/em> A love for your profession, the desire to do things the right way rather than the easy way (and not be motivated solely by money or ego), and to be always learning.<\/li><li><em>Maturity:<\/em> It seems strange to mention this, but being organized, being able to work autonomously, doing what you say you will (dependability), and loyalty are surprisingly not as universal as you\u2019d think. This also includes things like not changing frameworks to the latest hotness mid-project, just because.<\/li><li><em>Not being \u201cthat guy\u201d:<\/em> It takes all sorts, but good personal hygiene and social awareness definitely help. Not that this applies to you, dear reader, but not being an asshole is also important. Bottom line: you have to be someone other employees can cope interacting with for 8+ hours a day.<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>\u201cFit\u201d<\/strong> is the third category, and perhaps the one you can do the least about. You have to be a good fit for the team, both in terms of your skill set and your ability to work with them. It helps if you share some of the team\u2019s common values, and of course if you\u2019re a team player.

I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve got it completely\nfigured out yet, but it\u2019s fun to speculate.\n\nI\u2019m still fascinated by authentication and new user registration in general. The whole signup, login, logout\nprocess is nothing new. However, it is something that can continually be improved and the results can be\ndramatic.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @leahculver on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/leah-culver\/26-11-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Leah Culver","slug":"leah-culver","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/leah-culver\/2013-november-26","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000059401048\/801586da67388f3184461a398ae6762f_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1385366400","date":"2013-november-25","nicedate":"Monday, 25 November 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>Four years ago, my business partner and I quit our jobs to start a web design studio.

Admittedly, this meant being marched off to school in a\nseries of plum-colored home-sewn leisure suits throughout the late 70s. But for all the shame and inorganic\nfabric I endured, I also got to watch my mom work. The way a seamstress approaches her work isn\u2019t too far\noff from a designer. They decide to take on a client. They discuss your goals, which in her case were usually\nwedding dresses, her specialty. They discuss the wedding venue, the number of guests, how classy an affair it\nwas going to be. And after a glass of wine they discussed whether the dress would be white and everyone would\ngiggle. Then mom would bring out a photo album of dresses she\u2019d made for other brides, everyone would go\nthrough it oohing and ahhing. More wine would be poured. At some point the bridal magazines would come out and\npages would get ripped out and taped to a wall. \n\nThroughout the course of the dress getting made, the bride would come back to the house various times for\nfittings. Alterations would be made. Hems were adjusted based on smiles and frowns. Sometimes based on how\nmuch wine was poured. All the while it felt like they were doing this together. I mean, my mom literally\ncouldn\u2019t finish the dress without the client\u2019s involvement since it had to fit on the client\u2019s body. So\nboth the seamstress and the client had important roles to play. And my mother had absolutely no way of\nevaluating her work without the client\u2019s participation. \n\nAnd my mom didn\u2019t judge the work on how well it looked, or how much she got paid, or even how happy the\nclient was. She judged it on whether she\u2019d eventually be invited to the wedding. Which she usually was. With\nmy brothers and me in tow. And I can tell you, when the bride went up the aisle, and the crowd lit up, there\nwas nobody in the church more proud than my mom. That was her metric of success.\n\nI was lucky enough to watch all of this happen from the time I was old enough to remember. I was getting a\nmaster lesson in client services in my own house! From my own mother. A lesson on how to treat clients, how to\nbuild relationships with clients, and how to work *with* a client, instead of *for* a client.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @Mike_FTW on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/mike-monteiro\/19-11-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Mike Monteiro","slug":"mike-monteiro","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/mike-monteiro\/2013-november-19","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000855463905\/6cb24344f41440604a9f0a6fd0f1f92e_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1384761600","date":"2013-november-18","nicedate":"Monday, 18 November 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>Process is not inherently toxic.

Or was it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eoht.info\/page\/Last+person+to+know+everything\">Thomas Young<\/a>? Or Athanasius Kircher. Anyway, the point is not who this figure was but the story it tells. Of course there was never a person who knew everything but it says that at some point in our history the breadth of human knowledge became too much to contain within the mind of one person \u2014 that there became a point where there was too much to know.<\/p><p>In the relatively short history of our discipline of building things online it was not that long ago that it was (or felt) possible to know everything. Most of us that have been doing this for more than ten years have at some point had to be a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Polymath\">polymath<\/a>. In my first role as \u2018web designer\u2019 I was a one man team requiring me to know everything from colour theory to typography, through HTML, CSS and Javascript to setting up Apache and knuckling down to spit out some (dirty) PHP code. In an agency environment and with the explosion of teams building web products \u2014 as well as the sophistication of the tools we use \u2014 we have seen these roles fragment exponentially: programmers, back-end developers, front-end developers, web designers, UX designers, interaction designers. The list goes on. <\/p><p>There has become too much to know and with that we have seen the demise of the polymath. However, freelancers still generally tend to feel they have to do a bit of everything. This was something that came out of <a href=\"http:\/\/ournameismud.co.uk\/blog\/article\/freelance-rates-what-do-freelancers-charge\">the recent freelance survey we carried out<\/a> where over a third felt they had a mixture of skill sets, echoed in a recent discussion <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thefreelanceweb.com\/podcast\/ep22-specialising-vs-being-an-all-rounder\/\">on the Freelance Web podcast<\/a>.<\/p><p>Myself I\u2019ve always been a bit of a \u2018jack of all trades\u2019 \u2014 when I was an archaeologist I tried to have a broad knowledge of everything rather than focusing my knowledge on a particular area of expertise. This was very deliberate because I felt this afforded me a perspective that could bring diverse topics together into a whole. Furthermore I was also cautious about pursuing too far down one direction and not being able to turn back.<\/p><p>This approach carried across to my working online and over the years I have been a back-end developer, server manager, front-end developer, UX designer and visual designer. This range of work and experience \u2014 and perspective \u2014 has been immeasurably valuable to my career. However, with time I have come to appreciate the need to specialise for four reasons: <\/p><ol><li><p>Specialising fosters knowledge and expertise. There is simply too much to learn \u2014 the specs which define the foundations of our work are ever changing. The solutions we choose to adopt are a constant conversation. There is never a final answer. But specialisation helps us to build knowledge within an area and be part of that conversation rather than sitting outside as an observer.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Knowledge and expertise cultivates reputation. It is much easier to build a reputation as a specialist than as a generalist. As soon as I started focussing on specific areas of work I found it much easier to get work. When you specialise, <a href=\"http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/cole-henley\/2013-january-13\/\">write about your experiences<\/a> and help others with problems.  <\/p><\/li><li><p>Reputation builds connections. Once you specialise in a particular kind of work it becomes a lot easier to build networks and share skills with other specialists. Being a front-end developer, for example, opens up working opportunities with back-end developers and designers, as well as filling in skill gaps or bottlenecks at agencies that have a need for your area of specialism. <\/p><\/li><li><p>Finally being a specialist allows you to charge more because your skills (and expertise) are in greater demand. <\/p><\/li><\/ol><p>Specialism is not for everybody but remember that <a href=\"http:\/\/alistapart.com\/column\/you-cant-do-everything\">you can\u2019t do everything<\/a>. You\u2019ll need to try a broad range of things to discover what you love and what you\u2019re good at and a broad perspective is an important \u2014 essential \u2014 starting point. However with time I have learned that it is much easier (and rewarding) to find, focus on and hone one area of expertise.

But we\u2019re not in the business of easy. We\u2019re in the business of <em>doing it right<\/em>. If you don\u2019t know about unicode and internationalization, it\u2019s time to find out. Onward!<\/p><h2 id=\"encoding\">Encoding<\/h2><p>This is how computers map ones and zeroes to characters. Back in the day there was US-ASCII, which encoded 128 characters in 7-bit binary. Localized variants were introduced to accommodate foreign languages, leading to 8-bit ISO 8859-based encodings, and a whole mess of problems with incompatible encoding.<\/p><p>Unicode attempts to resolve this mess, and currently contains codepoints for more than 110,000 characters, covering 100 scripts. While there are a ton of encodings you <em>could<\/em> use, for the web <strong>use UTF-8<\/strong>. You want to use UTF-8 for your entire stack. So how do we get that?<\/p><h2 id=\"browsers\">Browsers<\/h2><p>First up, make sure your browsers auto-detect encoding, and set UTF-8 as the fallback. This should be the default.<\/p><h2 id=\"text-editors\">Text editors<\/h2><p>Your text editor should be set to always save documents as UTF-8. Luckily modern text editors already default to this. In general, don\u2019t save a Byte Order Mark (BOM) \u2014 it\u2019s not needed for UTF-8, and historically could cause problems.<\/p><h2 id=\"declaring-encoding\">Declaring character encoding<\/h2><p>According to HTML5, browsers determine an HTML page\u2019s encoding using the following <a href=\"http:\/\/www.whatwg.org\/specs\/web-apps\/current-work\/multipage\/parsing.html#determining-the-character-encoding\">encoding sniffing steps<\/a>:<\/p><ol><li>A user-set encoding, if there is one<\/li><li>A Byte Order Mark<\/li><li>An HTTP <code>charset<\/code> declaration in the web server\u2019s response headers (<code>Content-Type:text\/html; charset=UTF-8<\/code>)<\/li><li>A <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;&quot;&gt;<\/code> declaration in the HTML page\u2019s <code>&lt;head&gt;<\/code> (HTML5 style)<\/li><li>A <code>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;&quot;&gt;<\/code> element declaring <code>charset<\/code> in the HTML page\u2019s <code>&lt;head&gt;<\/code> (old-skool HTML 4.1 etc. style)<\/li><li>Heuristic analysis (= advanced guessing)<\/li><\/ol><h3 id=\"web-server\">Web server<\/h3><p>You want your web server to be sending the right <code>charset<\/code> declaration header (<code>Content-Type:text\/html; charset=UTF-8<\/code>), or at least not sending a <em>wrong<\/em> one. You can check this in the Network tab of your browser\u2019s developer tools \u2014 select the html page and look for <code>Content-Type<\/code> in the headers. You can also use tools such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/validator.w3.org\/i18n-checker\/\">W3C Internationalization Checker<\/a>.<\/p><p>If you\u2019re using an Apache server that\u2019s sending a non-UTF-8 <code>charset<\/code> header and you can edit <code>.htaccess<\/code>, you can set <code>charset<\/code> headers there:<\/p><pre><code>AddCharset utf-8 .html .htm .php .css .js<\/code><\/pre><p>This could also be set as part of setting the MIME type (although MIME types should already be set in Apache\u2019s <code>mime.types<\/code> file):<\/p><pre><code>AddType &#039;text\/html; charset=utf-8&#039; .html .htm .php\r\nAddType &#039;text\/css; charset=utf-8&#039; .css\r\nAddType &#039;text\/javascript; charset=utf-8&#039; .js<\/code><\/pre><p>Alternatively, if your URIs don\u2019t use file type extensions via <code>mod_negotiation<\/code> (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/Provider\/Style\/URI.html\">and they shouldn\u2019t<\/a>), Apache is pre-configured in <code>httpd-languages.conf<\/code> to treat file names that contain <code>.utf8<\/code> as UTF-8. This means documents named like <code>index.utf8.html<\/code> get the correct character set headers.<\/p><p>For those who can\u2019t change incorrect server headers, the HTML5 spec recently reordered the encoding sniffing steps to put the BOM above HTTP headers, so you have recourse. However, not all browsers support this, so it would be better to ask your server admin to fix this (or get a better server).<\/p><p>For information on setting headers for other servers, and in server side scripting languages, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/International\/O-HTTP-charset\">Setting the HTTP charset parameter<\/a> by Martin D\u00fcrst and Richard Ishida.<\/p><h3 id=\"inhtmlandcss\">In HTML and CSS<\/h3><p>Even if you\u2019ve set HTTP headers, it\u2019s a good idea to also add <code>charset<\/code> declarations to your documents.<\/p><p>Add <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; \/&gt;<\/code> to your HTML5 document\u2019s <code>&lt;head&gt;<\/code>, ideally immediately after the opening <code>&lt;head&gt;<\/code> tag. It must appear in the first 1024 bytes of your document, so place it before any ASCII art.<\/p><p>Browsers use a similar algorithm for CSS. For external stylesheets, the CSS equivalent of HTML\u2019s <code>&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;<\/code> is <code>@charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;;<\/code> at the top of your stylesheet \u2014 it must be the first thing in the CSS file. Embedded stylesheets use the encoding of the HTML page.<\/p><p>JavaScript doesn\u2019t have an equivalent character set declaration method, but this is normally not a problem. However, you can declare encoding for a script with the <code>charset<\/code> attribute: <code>&lt;script charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;[&hellip;]&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;<\/code>. Don\u2019t add <code>charset<\/code> to an embedded script \u2014 these take the encoding of the HTML page.<\/p><hr \/><h2 id=\"html\">HTML<\/h2><p>We\u2019ve covered declaring encoding, the most important step, above.<\/p><p>Next, if you\u2019ve got any forms for user-submitted data, add the <code>accept-charset<\/code> attribute so the browser sends UTF-8-encoded data:<\/p><p><code>html &lt;form action=&quot;[&hellip;]&quot; accept-charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;&hellip;&lt;\/form&gt;<\/code><\/p><p>If you\u2019re using <code>&lt;input type=&quot;email&quot;&gt;<\/code> it\u2019s nice to validate it client-side using HTML5\u2019s handy <code>pattern<\/code> attribute. You may be tempted to use something like <code>[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\\.[a-z]{2,4}<\/code> \u2014 don\u2019t! We have multi-byte URLs now, and you need to use a pattern like <code>[^ @]@[^ @]<\/code> to support them.<\/p><p>Because we\u2019re using UTF-8 we also no longer need to use escape codes such as <code>&amp;#8220;<\/code> and <code>&amp;#8221;<\/code> for curly quotes (\u201c\u201d) and the like \u2014 we can just add these characters directly. While it won\u2019t hurt if you do escape things, the only characters you <em>need<\/em> to escape when using literally in UTF-8-encoded HTML5 are:<\/p><ul><li><code>&lt;<\/code> Less-than sign \u2192 <code>&amp;lt;<\/code><\/li><li><code>&amp;<\/code> Ampersand \u2192 <code>&amp;amp;<\/code><\/li><\/ul><p>You\u2019ll also need to escape <code>&quot;<\/code> Quotation mark (\u2192 <code>&amp;quot;<\/code>) or <code>&#039;<\/code> Apostrophe (\u2192 <code>&amp;#39;<\/code>) if you use them in attribute text, such as an <code>alt<\/code> tag (or just use their \u201csmart\u201d equivalents). Here\u2019s a table on <a href=\"http:\/\/html5doctor.com\/blockquote-q-cite\/#punctuation-characters\">how to type quotation characters directly<\/a>.<\/p><p>Next, declare a page\u2019s language by using the <code>lang<\/code> attribute. First, set the document\u2019s main language in the HTML tag. For example, a mainly Japanese document would use the language tag <code>ja<\/code>:<\/p><pre><code>&lt;html lang=&quot;ja&quot;&gt;<\/code><\/pre><p>To find out a language\u2019s tag, search for the language using Richard Ishida\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/rishida.net\/utils\/subtags\/\">Language Subtag Lookup<\/a>. You can add further information, such as a dialect (<code>en-US<\/code> for American English) or script (<code>ja-latn<\/code> for Romanized Japanese), but only do so if it adds important information. If you then want to include text in other languages on the page, add the appropriate <code>lang=&quot;<\/code> attribute to an element wrapping the text.<\/p><p>HTML5 relaxes the restrictions on valid ID names, so you can now use <a href=\"http:\/\/mathiasbynens.be\/notes\/html5-id-class\">nearly anything as an ID name<\/a>, such as <code>id=&quot;\u263a&quot;<\/code> or <code>id=&quot;\u5927\u4e8b&quot;<\/code>, the same as class names.

As a web developer, you have probably learned most of the techniques you are using from the internet, from people you respect for sharing their work and knowledge with you.<\/p><p>Now, we all know it is hard to find good resources online (technical articles, for example). This is where content providers jump in. There are numerous content providers and, as ridiculous as this may sound, everyone here profits from them.<\/p><p>Take the examples of Smashing Magazine and .net magazine, two of the biggest content providers in the web design industry. They collect articles from different authors, edit them and publish them in a single place, easily accessible to readers. This is undeniably a good thing: the authors get paid and can start to make a name for themselves. The readers profit from a collection of high-quality articles all in one place. The provider profits both from the authors\u2019 content and financially, be it in the form of direct payment from readers or advertising revenue. <\/p><p>But there are some simple rules required for this to work. The system we just described, as the old saying goes, works fine until it breaks. Content providers are hosted third-party platforms. Authors have no direct influence on them and the content they have provided may well simply disappear at some point. When this happens, there are suddenly a lot of problems:<\/p><ul><li>Readers can\u2019t find the content anymore.<\/li><li>Authors are upset because their content has disappeared.<\/li><li>If the comments disappear, discussions on articles no longer make sense.<\/li><li>Articles spread around the internet. When they do, authors reference them in their own work. But now, all the links to the original article are broken and the newer articles lose their context or even their meaning.<\/li><\/ul><p>These exact issues have often come up. It\u2019s never ended well. I\u2019ve often asked myself how to solve the problem. Unfortunately there is no simple answer. To start off, we are going to have to change our mindset a little bit and make content independent from these large-scale hosted third party platforms.<\/p><p>I sometimes wonder if I should just write articles on my own blog. The thing is, it\u2019s much more enjoyable publishing on a platform with thousands of readers. So, for me at least, the issue is whether I want to spread a message to the masses, which is only doable via content providers, or whether I simply want to share it with a few friends and casual readers. The latter works fine on your own blog. Sadly, the other really doesn\u2019t. <\/p><p>But there may be a solution that doesn\u2019t involve losing most of your readership: Content providers usually want to secure all rights in return for publishing a writer's work. This means you as an author probably won\u2019t be allowed to re-publish it elsewhere. If you are getting paid for your content this might be OK. If you\u2019re not, though, it\u2019s pretty disappointing, especially if your content is then removed from the provider's site and so becomes unavailable to anyone.<\/p><p>I\u2019ve struggled to work out what a solution might look like, but one idea is this: authors publish their work on their own sites and content provider sites then just copy it from them and provide a link to the original. That way, if the content provider shuts down, the article is still reachable. It works the other way too: if the author shuts down their blog, the content provider would still have a cached copy. It is currently just a rough solution and there are problems that need to be solved but I really do believe this could form part of a solution to the issues we face right now.<\/p><p>But until someone solves them entirely, I can only encourage you all to always make backups of your articles and to try and avoid contracts where you lose permission to publish the content yourself.

And why do bloggers write articles\nfor free?\n\nIt all comes down to people loving what they do and wanting others to know about it. As a web developer, you\nhave probably learned most of the techniques you are using from the internet, from people you respect for\nsharing their work and knowledge with you.\n\nNow, we all know it is hard to find good resources online (technical articles, for example). This is where\ncontent providers jump in. There are numerous content providers and, as ridiculous as this may sound, everyone\nhere profits from them.\n\nTake the examples of Smashing Magazine and .net magazine, two of the biggest content providers in the web\ndesign industry. They collect articles from different authors, edit them and publish them in a single place,\neasily accessible to readers. This is undeniably a good thing: the authors get paid and can start to make a\nname for themselves. The readers profit from a collection of high-quality articles all in one place. The\nprovider profits both from the authors\u2019 content and financially, be it in the form of direct payment from\nreaders or advertising revenue. \n\nBut there are some simple rules required for this to work. The system we just described, as the old saying\ngoes, works fine until it breaks. Content providers are hosted third-party platforms. Authors have no direct\ninfluence on them and the content they have provided may well simply disappear at some point. When this\nhappens, there are suddenly a lot of problems:\n\n *  Readers can\u2019t find the content anymore.\n\n *  Authors are upset because their content has disappeared.\n\n *  If the comments disappear, discussions on articles no longer make sense.\n\n *  Articles spread around the internet. When they do, authors reference them in their own work. But now, all\nthe links to the original article are broken and the newer articles lose their context or even their\nmeaning.\n\nThese exact issues have often come up. It\u2019s never ended well.

My Twitter timeline this week was a mix of confusion *(People actually followed that\nthing?)*, dismissive non-surprise *(Didn\u2019t everyone think it was a person? I did)*, and a decent amount of\ngenuine disappointment.\n\nMeyer describes our sadness about the Horse news as being about a loss of innocence, and a desire to believe\nthat we were always the ones in control:\n\n> We believed we were watching the digital\n> work mutter happily to itself about us, its anxious masters. Maybe the digital world was trying to sell us\n> something, too, but its method of doing so was so blissfully ignorant, so warmly earnest, somehow, that we\n> obliged. We loved @horse_ebooks because it was seerlike, childlike. \n> But no: There were people behind it all along. We thought we were obliging a program, a thing which needs no\n> obliging, whereas in fact we were falling for a plan.\n\nHe sees this as a sign of the account\u2019s success as a work of fiction and he may be right, but I can\u2019t help\nseeing it as a metaphor for our relationship with the Internet at large right now. *We thought we\nwere\u2026obliging a thing which needs no obliging, whereas in fact we were falling for a plan.*We, tech savvy\nfolk that we are, assumed we had all of this figured out. Gmail gives us free email in exchange for selling\nads next to what we\u2019re reading; Facebook lets us update our friends and share our vacation photos in\nexchange for selling us ads, etc. \n\n*If you\u2019re not paying for a service, you\u2019re what\u2019s being sold.* \n\nHow comfortable you were with that aphorism dictated the extent to which you used those services or platforms,\nhow you configured your privacy settings, and what you shared with whom.\n\nNow, of course, it\u2019s become apparent that there were parties in this social contract that we weren\u2019t aware\nof \u2014 the NSA may not be *reading* our personal emails any more than Google is, but it appears [they\u2019ve had\naccess all along](http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2013\/7\/17\/4517480\/nsa-spying-prism-surveillance-cheat-sheet). One\nneedn\u2019t be particularly familiar with dystopian fiction to find this notion a bit unsettling. Like Google\noffering us email in exchange for serving up \u201ccontextually relevant\u201d advertising, the government offers us\nnational security, in exchange for unfettered access to our personal communications. While it\u2019s not entirely\nclear exactly *how* the NSA collects our data, the current understanding seems to be that this isn\u2019t a\nmatter of [superior cryptography skills and computing\npower](http:\/\/www.propublica.org\/article\/the-nsas-secret-campaign-to-crack-undermine-internet-encryption), but\nrather that these breaches are more a matter of the government flexing its Patriot Act muscles. \n\nMaybe this shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Maybe we only have part of the story. Maybe this is the cost of doing\nbusiness in the 21st century. Maybe this is making us safer and it\u2019s a small price to pay. \n\nEven if all of those things are true, I suspect it is also true that for many of us, our fundamental\nunderstanding of the Internet has shifted. When the biggest \u201cthreat\u201d to our Utopian ideal of the Internet\nwas commercial interests, it was easier to believe that we were still in control. There were always options:\nad-blocks and opt-outs and ultimately, leaving platforms all together. In fact, the very notion that something\nnew and better is about to jump out around the next corner seems core to how we understand the Internet today.\nWhen it\u2019s always expanding, the stakes lower. Someday, we\u2019ll all be sharing our personal lives on the new\nFacebook or Twitter, just like we joined those services as we left MySpace and LiveJournal behind.\n\nNow it seems the stakes have changed all together. When Facebook misreads my data and starts serving me ads\ntargeted at new parents, it\u2019s mostly comical, if perhaps a little existentially stressful. If the government\nmisreads my data, the possible consequences are entirely different \u2014 and short of leaving the internet,\nthere doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to opt out.\n\nThe trade offs used to be obvious. Put up with a few spam tweets and the occasional ad from Twitter, and you\ngot to see what that absurd Horse came up with next.

I\u2019m so lucky.\u201d<\/p><p>It\u2019s something I think and feel each and every day. The thing is, thinking and feeling <em>I\u2019m fortunate and lucky<\/em> kind of feels crazy. Crazy because this week, this month, and this year have been filled with chaos and challenges.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, I ended up in bed sick for about three weeks. I had a severe case of sinusitis which meant I couldn\u2019t smell and my entire body felt like there were spiders crawling underneath my skin (a side-effect of the medication). I couldn\u2019t drive or leave the house because the medication was so strong that it altered my vision and motor function. During this time my husband flew 1,300 miles away to help his mom through cancer treatments, all while other members of my family were going through a similarly difficult time plagued with destructive illness. It was a time filled with lots of chaos and challenges. The weird thing was, I <em>still<\/em> felt lucky. <\/p><p>Through these experiences, I gained perspective on things like: time, health, and relationships. Sometimes, life stinks and sometimes it seems especially odoriferous. Even still, I wake every day and think to myself, \u201cI\u2019m so fortunate. I\u2019m so lucky.\u201d This year has been tough but I am fortunate to have gained: perspective, patience, and understanding. I am fortunate to be surrounded by good people.<\/p><p>I may feel lucky, but I don\u2019t really believe in luck. I do believe that I can feel lucky and I can be perceived to be lucky. I believe working hard leads to good fortune\u2014that being prepared for opportunity and being ready to embrace it makes you seem lucky to those around you, even when your world is upside down.<\/p><p>Many of us in our industry are perceived as lucky. However, we are not here today, collaborating on exciting projects and exploring new worlds, because we are lucky. We are here because we wanted more. We wanted more from life and we\u2019ve been willing to put forth the effort to accomplish this. <\/p><p>How we roll, as an industry, is by rolling up our sleeves and getting stuff done. We jump in headfirst and we submerse our entire beings into our work. So much so, that our lives and work are interwoven into one tangled, beautiful mess. <\/p><p>And when we can\u2019t find opportunity, we make it. What did comedian Milton Berle once say: \u201cIf opportunity doesn\u2019t knock, build a door\u201d? We are an industry made of people who build doors for ourselves <em>and<\/em> for others. Then, we take steps to open the doors and cross over the thresholds\u2014often crossing thresholds <em>together<\/em>.<\/p><p>In life, we are faced with a variety of doors that we can walk through. Some are heavy\u2014really heavy\u2014and we cannot open them ourselves. This is when we call on our friends, family, and colleagues to let them know our goals and to let them know that we need assistance in opening a door, a door that will lead us on a new journey and bring more opportunities.<\/p><p>Most people want to help and by allowing them to help, we give them the opportunity to feel good about themselves. We allow them to make a positive difference in our lives. My friends, family, and colleagues supported me when I was sick and faced serious life challenges. These same people know that when they need me to provide extra support for them, I will be there\u2014wherever their \u201cthere\u201d may be.<\/p><p>When we start and end each day by focusing on things that make us feel fortunate, we begin to frame our lives in a way that seems fortunate. Instead of falling victim to my circumstances, I view this year\u2019s sickness, chaos, and challenges as opportunities. It\u2019s up to me to take these situations and apply what I\u2019ve learned to my life. It\u2019s up to me to recognize when opportunity is knocking, even when it is disguised as chaos.

It should always go both ways: from inside out and\nfrom outside in.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @lucasratmundo on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/lucas-rocha\/24-09-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Lucas Rocha","slug":"lucas-rocha","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/lucas-rocha\/2013-september-24","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3720264206\/ea4d0efa7e7c23298d6b82c0ac5e5509_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1379923200","date":"2013-september-23","nicedate":"Monday, 23 September 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>This month, I couldn\u2019t come up with anything worth listening to more than this fantastic set of tweets by Kathy Sierra:<\/p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>In the well-intended, crucial quest for conference speaker diversity, are we also sending the (wrong) message that Presenting = Success?<\/p>&mdash; Seriouspony (@seriouspony) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/seriouspony\/statuses\/381447980227624961\">September 21, 2013<\/a><\/blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Just that some of us (e.g. me) were drawn to programming *because* social networking, presentations, etc. were NOT career requirements.<\/p>&mdash; Seriouspony (@seriouspony) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/seriouspony\/statuses\/381448502603051009\">September 21, 2013<\/a><\/blockquote><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>There are so many paths available for making contributions to our domain.

A week later our dream project would come along and we\u2019d have to turn it down due to lack of resources. I\u2019d hate to think how many amazing opportunities we lost because we couldn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d. We\u2019d find ourselves working on projects that paid the bills, but were hardly stimulating\u2014 things that wouldn\u2019t sit proudly in our portfolio or further our goals. On occasion we\u2019d be stuck with difficult or unpleasant customers and wish we\u2019d said \u201cno\u201d from the outset. Despite this, we\u2019d continue to struggle on regardless.<\/p><p>Too many designers operate from a position of fear, worrying where the next check will come from. They\u2019ll try to win every client that comes their way, whether they are suitable or not.<\/p><p>This attitude helps fuel one of our industry\u2019s least endearing qualities\u2014the tendency to bitch about clients. The thing is, as a company you chose the people you work with, so it\u2019s your fault rather than theirs.<\/p><p>While most agencies try to win every project by promising to deliver everything the client wants and more, we take a radically different approach.<\/p><p>It\u2019s my job to make sure a client is a good fit for Clearleft, so I\u2019ll sound out their attitudes to quality, how they like to collaborate, and their management style. I\u2019ve got very good at spotting the type of clients we work best with, and the warning signs to look out for.<\/p><p>It\u2019s also my job to see whether we\u2019re going to be a good fit for the client, and I\u2019ll regularly turn down work because I think somebody else would do a better job. This may seem like a strange attitude, but I feel a duty of care to the people who approach us and want to offer the best advice possible, even if that means recommending somebody else (which I do a lot).<\/p><p>We\u2019re also very honest with our prospective clients and don\u2019t play the sales game\u2014we\u2019re designers after all. Instead we\u2019ll explain that they won\u2019t get everything they want, that the process will be hard and that we\u2019ll make a few wrong turns along the way.

With only a semester or two left in each case, at most a year of classes in one\ninstance, I found this hard to believe. Especially as this happened over and over. However, I gave this person\nthe benefit of the doubt.\n\nOver the years I noticed similar patterns. Eventually, this person never finished any degree and instead moved\non to the idea of starting their own business. With another friend of mine, they cooked up an idea that had\nthe same fate as this person\u2019s schooling, and after it, another. Each business idea would spool up, and then\nbefore the product or service could really shine, this person always found some reason to shut it down and\nmove on. This was frustrating as I saw a lot of promise in some of the ideas and strategies; I could have seen\nseveral of them become legitimate startups. Many of the ideas were niche and the ideas to accommodate them\nwere innovative. Still, they never followed through and I didn\u2019t understand why. I didn\u2019t understand why\nsomeone so bright and creative would get so close to completion, so close to success and then just walk away\nleaving only a paper-thin excuse behind.\n\nI remember the day I thought to myself that they may be afraid of success. We were at my house and I was\nlistening to them hatch another plan with the same assurances and the same renewed vigour for it that came\nwith every new plan. I interrupted this person, which in retrospect I admit was rude, and I blurted out,\n\n\u201cYou know, I really think you might be afraid to win. I think you\u2019re afraid of being successful, and all\nthe responsibility that you\u2019re not actually prepared for that might come with it. Every six months, every\nyear that passes you\u2019re onto something new. Nothing ever gets finished. No risk is actually taken, and I\nthink it\u2019s because you\u2019re afraid of success more than you are of failing, because you had this pattern in\nschool close to graduation before you ever had it in business. You\u2019re doing the same thing right now.\u201d\n\nPredictably, they did not respond well to this idea. Sometimes people are not very good at taking observations\nothers make in stride. Eventually, one day, this person did admit that perhaps that could be a part of why\nthey do what they do, but it was clear they didn\u2019t want to talk about it very much out loud to another\nperson if that was true. I decided to respect that suspicion and let it be. Unfortunately, we do not keep in\ntouch anymore, for reasons that are unrelated to this encounter. However, I do know what this person\u2019s doing\nbecause the internet affords me the privilege of being able to keep up on old friends. \n\nFor several years now this person\u2019s been working on a web application, and in all that time it\u2019s never\ncome out of beta. I\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ve tried it, and what it definitely needs is actual non-beta users to\nget any better. Nothing replaces user testing. Nothing replaces production-level mass-user testing on a site\nyou hope to reach a large audience with. I can\u2019t help but suspect they know this, and that being in beta\nforever is another manifestation of their fear of success.\n\nMaybe you are afraid of releasing your code open source because you are afraid of having to maintain it,\nespecially if it gets popular. Maybe you are afraid that your code will be popular, and then attract a lot of\nscrutiny. Maybe you are afraid of showing your boss how you optimized the entire order-taking system of your\nbusiness because then he\u2019ll expect that same level of ingenuity and performance as a baseline and you\ndon\u2019t think you can keep up consistently long-term. Maybe, just maybe, you\u2019re afraid of success because\nyou don\u2019t know what it looks like, and so maybe you\u2019re afraid of the unknown. You might even have both a\nfear of success and a fear of failure, which may make circumstances even more challenging.\n\nAt least, with failure, you can kind of guess at what failing will be like most of the time. You can say that\nif you don\u2019t complete a feature on time, you may get in trouble or even lose your job. If you don\u2019t pass\nan exam, you could fail a course in school. We spend a lot more time focusing on the consequences of failure\nthan on the consequences of success, and this is a problem.\n\nWhen it comes to the fear of success, there is only one way to deal with it that I know of: take the risk. You\nknow you have something good but you don\u2019t know what that will mean for you in the future, but if you\ndon\u2019t take that chance then it may pass you by and the opportunity will be lost. Life is for living, and it\nis all too short. If you don\u2019t take the chance, you risk a life filled with regrets. You risk a life with\npromise that was never shared with the rest of us, the world, and that is a sad thing. We want your greatness,\nso bring it out, and I promise you\u2019ll find others like you that will want to help you navigate whatever\ncomes next along the way. \n\nYeah, sure \u2014 I don\u2019t know what will come next for you any more than you do, but the same is true of any\nday you live, and any path you choose since we cannot predict when your life may be over from circumstances\nother than natural causes. Your projects are no different than a day in your life so to speak, so take the\nplunge and see what happens. It\u2019s worth the emotional risk.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @angelinamagnum on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/angelina-fabbro\/18-09-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Angelina Fabbro","slug":"angelina-fabbro","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/angelina-fabbro\/2013-september-18","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1697997711\/grainyme_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1379404800","date":"2013-september-17","nicedate":"Tuesday, 17 September 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>My first best friend was a girl named Michelle who lived across the street.

Of all the animals Frank loved the cow best. And in time, with help from his mother, he learned to milk it. <\/p><p>So when Frank grew up he moved to the valley, found himself a job, and managed to save up enough for a small piece of dirt and some cows. And he set himself up milking those cows, who he took good care of. The cows rewarded Frank for his love by producing enough milk that Frank set up a little store next to his farm and began selling milk to his neighbors. <\/p><p>Frank made enough money at the little store that he bought a few more cows and started selling his milk to the folk in the nearest town. And Frank got himself a little truck to make deliveries. And hired a few local folk to help him milk the cows, who he always treated well.<\/p><p>Frank grew to love delivering milk and seeing the smiling faces of his customers as much as he loved milking cows and he decided he wanted to make even more people happy. He wanted to supply the entire valley with milk.<\/p><p>So he approached the rich gentlemen of the valley. He put together a deck. And a five-year plan. And got his finances in order. And put on his best suit. And invited the rich gentlemen of the valley over to his farm. He gave them a tour. Showed them his cows.

Many were patronizing and offered little in the way of substance to help me do away with this behaviour. In fact, the one thing that bothered me the most was that these books assumed that this behaviour could be \u2018cured\u2019 at all. Some habits are difficult if not impossible to change, and I\u2019d been operating this way since I was a child. The habits that start young are the most pernicious to erase when you try and get at them. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying, in the case of procrastination \u2014 society has made it very clear that procrastinators must be lazy, ineffectual people. I certainly didn\u2019t (and don\u2019t) want to be a lazy and ineffectual person. At some point I decided to stop making myself feel guilty. Plenty of successful people I admire admit to habits of procrastination, and they still achieve and accomplish great things. So what\u2019s the catch?<\/p><p>Functional procrastination.<\/p><p>So say it out loud with me if you\u2019re frustrated with the shame of procrastination and the impetus to combat it:<\/p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably always going to procrastinate, so instead I\u2019m going to make it work for me.\u201d<\/p><p>So what does this look like in practice? The first step is probably obvious, and it is to identify the reason that you are procrastinating. This is the hardest step because it means being totally honest with yourself about your behaviour, and if you\u2019re not used to that you can and will dance around the reason. It helps to have a list like the one I\u2019ve compiled above, you\u2019re welcome to use it as a starting point or generate your own. Some people will tell themselves that they really and truly can\u2019t find a reason and that this has no cause. For most people I think this means they have not been honest or given enough time to figure it out; although I bet there are a few outliers who genuinely struggle with biology that gets in the way too. The most important thing? Be honest with yourself.<\/p><p>Sometimes identifying the reason is enough. I know for myself, in the case where I recognize that I feel overwhelmed by a project, that the next step is to break it down into smaller parts. Then I can take on the larger project piece by piece. Sometimes once you know the reason, the path becomes clear. But often we don\u2019t know how to break down a task further, or maybe that\u2019s not what is making us procrastinate.<\/p><p>So, instead, do the following: procrastinate your task with another task that you had previously been procrastinating. Repeat as needed. <\/p><p>If you have a deadline or a set of deadlines you are working with your cycle of procrastination will probably need to be accelerated or altered, as it might be under time pressure. Usually the stress of the deadline means that you complete the task very close to the deadline. This is dangerous as it means you may compromise on quality. I actually recommend procrastinating projects often and early. Cycle through them, never get bored, and always be looking at the task in front of you with fresh eyes.<\/p><p>For personal projects or anything outside of your employment where a deadline is not required, do not set a deadline. It\u2019s tempting to set deadlines on personal projects, because haven\u2019t we been told our entire lives that every goal needs to have one? What if instead of this, you simply say to yourself,<\/p><p>\u201cI want to accomplish this task, and I know I will eventually, and I\u2019m okay with the fact that I don\u2019t know when that will be. I\u2019ll finish it when I\u2019m excited about it, and this process may not be temporally contiguous.\u201d<\/p><p>Then, iterate. When you hit a block with a project, switch to another one. Don\u2019t guilt yourself over it, don\u2019t hesitate, don\u2019t tell yourself that \u2018this isn\u2019t how normal people operate\u2019. Yes, it is. Lots of us do it. I\u2019m not going to sit here and have someone tell me that this way of operating is bad behaviour. If you\u2019re producing and you complete things eventually, then who cares? Don\u2019t let anyone else judge you, your process is your own, and if it works? It works. That\u2019s all that matters.<\/p><p>In the case of fear of success or fear of failure, things can get very ambiguous and this process might break down for you. I don\u2019t have any simple answers for you on how to deal with these in the framing of this strategy. You need to keep asking yourself \u2018why\u2019 and try to get at the core of how you are feeling, which in turn will probably help you figure out how to break down dealing with yourself, which in turn may deliver you with something actionable. This is a topic that warrants an entire pastry all to itself, and these are things I will likely write about in future cupcakes.<\/p><p>Embrace your behaviour and make it work for you.

Procrastinate on.<\/p><p>This post brought to you by a very overdue submission after way too many days of procrastination and reflecting on said procrastination. True story.<\/p>","thought_markdown":"\n\n# Stop Feeling Guilty: Functional Procrastination\n\nIn one of my previous pastries, I talked about how you should always ask yourself why you do the things that\nyou do. The premise of this was that if you consistently question yourself, you develop self-awareness and\nhopefully an understanding of your behaviour. With this information you might be able to change or accommodate\nyour behaviour in order to more efficiently achieve your goals. \n\nOne of the questions I posed in that pastry about myself was \u2018Why do I procrastinate the things I love?\u2019\nSometimes, I will deliberately ignore or avoid a task or project that I\u2019m actually in love with. It\u2019s\nparadoxical in nature. Once I started to pick apart the behaviours and found my way inside their pattern, a\nwhole lot became clear.\n\nThis is what behaviour would occur:\n\n *  I would pick a task or project that interests me greatly with a determined end state.\n\n *  Then I would fall in love with said task or project and work obsessively on it for some amount of\ntime\n\n *  At some point I would stop working on said task or project for reasons unclear to me\n\n *  Then I would likely wrestle with desire to finish project but feel overcome with apathy\n\n *  Procrastination occurs.\n\n *  I then repeat 5 an arbitrary number of times\n\nI came to loathe this pattern once I recognized that particular things weren\u2019t getting done. It didn\u2019t\nseem like there was any reason that I did this, and it stressed me out that I didn\u2019t understand my own\nbehaviour. Surely there must be a reason. I never like it when my behaviour does not make rational sense,\nwhich is frustrating because I am predisposed to be irrational as frequently as the next person.\n\nTo skip ahead of a lot of self-inquiry and discussions with peers who confront this same issue, I compiled a\nlist of possible reasons for my procrastination:\n\n *  A fear of failure (because even if failure is important to progress in many cases, we are conditioned to\nfeel shame from it by our culture(s))\n\n *  A fear of success (and all of the responsibility that comes with it that we might not be prepared\nfor)\n\n *  No clear path to solving the problem or completing the project or task is apparent\n\n *  The project is overwhelming to think about because it has not been broken down into more digestible\ntasks\n\n *  Boredom from tedious tasks in the way of completing the more interesting project as a whole\n\n *  Boredom from being on the same task or project for too long without a break due to time pressures or\nobligation\n\n *  Inability to decide on one of many potential solutions or paths to completing the task or\nproject\n\nThere are probably many more items I could add to this list, but I\u2019m merely speaking from the anecdotes of\nmy own experience as I usually do when I compose these doughnuts. Sometimes more than one of them apply to me\nat any given point. Another important thing I recognized is that my level of distractibility and\nprocrastination are very correlated. It seems that this is often the case for other people too.\n\nOver the years people have recommended a lot of different books to me on \u2018overcoming procrastination\u2019 and\nI found only bits and pieces of them marginally useful. Many were patronizing and offered little in the way of\nsubstance to help me do away with this behaviour. In fact, the one thing that bothered me the most was that\nthese books assumed that this behaviour could be \u2018cured\u2019 at all. Some habits are difficult if not\nimpossible to change, and I\u2019d been operating this way since I was a child. The habits that start young are\nthe most pernicious to erase when you try and get at them. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying, in the case of\nprocrastination \u2014 society has made it very clear that procrastinators must be lazy, ineffectual people. I\ncertainly didn\u2019t (and don\u2019t) want to be a lazy and ineffectual person. At some point I decided to stop\nmaking myself feel guilty. Plenty of successful people I admire admit to habits of procrastination, and they\nstill achieve and accomplish great things. So what\u2019s the catch?\n\nFunctional procrastination.\n\nSo say it out loud with me if you\u2019re frustrated with the shame of procrastination and the impetus to combat\nit:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably always going to procrastinate, so instead I\u2019m going to make it work for me.\u201d\n\nSo what does this look like in practice? The first step is probably obvious, and it is to identify the reason\nthat you are procrastinating. This is the hardest step because it means being totally honest with yourself\nabout your behaviour, and if you\u2019re not used to that you can and will dance around the reason. It helps to\nhave a list like the one I\u2019ve compiled above, you\u2019re welcome to use it as a starting point or generate\nyour own. Some people will tell themselves that they really and truly can\u2019t find a reason and that this has\nno cause. For most people I think this means they have not been honest or given enough time to figure it out;\nalthough I bet there are a few outliers who genuinely struggle with biology that gets in the way too. The most\nimportant thing? Be honest with yourself.\n\nSometimes identifying the reason is enough. I know for myself, in the case where I recognize that I feel\noverwhelmed by a project, that the next step is to break it down into smaller parts. Then I can take on the\nlarger project piece by piece. Sometimes once you know the reason, the path becomes clear. But often we\ndon\u2019t know how to break down a task further, or maybe that\u2019s not what is making us procrastinate.\n\nSo, instead, do the following: procrastinate your task with another task that you had previously been\nprocrastinating. Repeat as needed. \n\nIf you have a deadline or a set of deadlines you are working with your cycle of procrastination will probably\nneed to be accelerated or altered, as it might be under time pressure. Usually the stress of the deadline\nmeans that you complete the task very close to the deadline. This is dangerous as it means you may compromise\non quality. I actually recommend procrastinating projects often and early. Cycle through them, never get\nbored, and always be looking at the task in front of you with fresh eyes.\n\nFor personal projects or anything outside of your employment where a deadline is not required, do not set a\ndeadline. It\u2019s tempting to set deadlines on personal projects, because haven\u2019t we been told our entire\nlives that every goal needs to have one? What if instead of this, you simply say to yourself,\n\n\u201cI want to accomplish this task, and I know I will eventually, and I\u2019m okay with the fact that I don\u2019t\nknow when that will be. I\u2019ll finish it when I\u2019m excited about it, and this process may not be temporally\ncontiguous.\u201d\n\nThen, iterate. When you hit a block with a project, switch to another one. Don\u2019t guilt yourself over it,\ndon\u2019t hesitate, don\u2019t tell yourself that \u2018this isn\u2019t how normal people operate\u2019. Yes, it is. Lots of\nus do it. I\u2019m not going to sit here and have someone tell me that this way of operating is bad behaviour. If\nyou\u2019re producing and you complete things eventually, then who cares? Don\u2019t let anyone else judge you, your\nprocess is your own, and if it works? It works. That\u2019s all that matters.\n\nIn the case of fear of success or fear of failure, things can get very ambiguous and this process might break\ndown for you. I don\u2019t have any simple answers for you on how to deal with these in the framing of this\nstrategy. You need to keep asking yourself \u2018why\u2019 and try to get at the core of how you are feeling, which\nin turn will probably help you figure out how to break down dealing with yourself, which in turn may deliver\nyou with something actionable.

This process of thought escalation happens to a lot of us creative folks. I notice this happens to me when the veiled illusion of control over my life is lifted. Reality is exposed: there are a lot of things in life I have little control over. This is when thoughts as small as a snowflakes clump together to form rough weather in my mind.<\/p><p>This escalation in rough weather, formed by fear and anxiety, doesn\u2019t <em>just<\/em> happen to us, we <em>allow<\/em> it to happen to us. The one thing we have any real control over is our thoughts. When the veiled illusion of control is ripped away exposing the nerve (that is, my fear) to the elements (the reality of life) I\u2019m in control of what I do with my thoughts.<\/p><p>When I feel in limbo and feel I have no control over anything, I remind myself to <strong>be where my feet are<\/strong>.<\/p><p>I say these five words to myself. Then, I press my feet onto the floor and ground myself. I feel my feet firmly planted on the ground and I\u2019m grateful that I have two feet. I\u2019m grateful that I have the strength, ability, and life to be able to press them to the ground.<\/p><p>I become fully present in the moment and stop thinking about the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d or the \u201cwhens.\u201d Instead, I\u2019m mindful of my present state. I\u2019m aware of me. I\u2019m aware of where my feet are. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m alive and that\u2019s way better than the alternative. I am grateful. I am present. I am just me, in that moment. I do not have to be surrounded by swirling cold winds carrying snow and inclement weather. I create a momentary oasis that allows me to breathe in the warmth of life and breathe out the cold of fear.<\/p><p>However, I can\u2019t just press my feet to the ground and visualize a peaceful oasis all day. Although that would be nice, I have work to do. I\u2019ve come to realize I feel more relaxed when I can find a way to create an effective process for a task I often repeat. Below is one of the processes I\u2019ve adopted and adapted that helps me get things done, so I can focus on being present.<\/p><p>I use <a href=\"http:\/\/trello.com\">Trello<\/a>, a free online organizational tool, to help me sort out much of my life. It works both in my professional and personal life, which is good because the two blur the edges so often that I rarely know the difference. Oh, and I don\u2019t have anything to do with Trello. The folks there don\u2019t know how much I love their product, unless they\u2019re reading this now.<\/p><p>One day, I needed to relax so I started researching an effective process for a repeated task using Trello. I came across this post by Angela Bowman, <cite><a href=\"http:\/\/angelab.me\/how-to-manage-your-physical-mental-and-creative-space-with-trello\/\">How to Manage Your Physical, Mental, and Creative Space With Trello<\/a><\/cite>.<\/p><p>I was really interested in what Angela wrote about how space affects creativity and how to manage space using Trello. She made a lot of sense, and reading the <a href=\"http:\/\/goinswriter.com\/creative-space\/\">post by Jeff Goins<\/a> that Angela referenced helped clarify things even further. Jeff describes the three spaces in our creative lives like this:<\/p><ol><li>Physical space: There is a relationship between the place you work and the work you do.<\/li><li>Mental space: If your mind is consumed with worries and concerns\u2014pending deadlines and to-do items\u2014you won\u2019t be thinking clearly. <\/li><li>Spiritual space: Creativity is a spiritual act, a work of the heart. If my internal life is messy, can you imagine what that means for what I\u2019ll create? You guessed it\u2014<em>a mess<\/em>.<\/li><\/ol><p>I like the ideas of different spaces and how they affect your creativity. I\u2019ve always believed this and known it to be true in my own life. When my physical space is messy, I know my emotional space is messy. But I\u2019ve never used this idea of spaces in my to-do lists before. Since reading these articles, I started to use this concept in practice and it really worked for me. I started to get more to-do items done and I felt a lot more grounded in <em>all<\/em> of my spaces.

I was part of the last wave of douchebags that came here to\nstrike it rich. I was one of *those* people. But I stayed, and I made this city my home. I love this city. It\nis insane. It is a mess. It is broken. And it is beautiful. \n\nSan Francisco has been dealing with *those* people, those who came here to strike it rich, for a very long\ntime. Whether it be missionaries looking for savage souls to save, miners looking for gold, or nerds looking\nfor funding, San Francisco does a decent job of attracting the hopeful, culling out the douchebags, and\nrebuilding itself around those it wants to keep. \n\nThis list is in no way exhaustive. Nor it is an attempt to gloss over some of the city\u2019s serious problems.\nBut it\u2019s a reason to believe those problems are worth solving.\n\n## Karl the Fog\n\nLook up towards Twin Peaks around mid-afternoon and you\u2019ll see one of the most amazing sights in the world.\nA beautiful blanket of fog about to descend upon the city. And I\u2019m not talking about some weak-ass mild fog.\nI\u2019m talking about a thick luxurious milky blanket of cool air that protects the city from the ridiculous\nheat the rest of the country\u2019s been dealing with. Karl is a gift. \n\n## Burritos\n\nWe can\u2019t make pizza for shit. Fact. But we don\u2019t need to. Because if you were eating pizza you\u2019d have\nless room for that burrito from Taqueria Cancun. It\u2019s less than $10 and fits perfectly in the water bottle\nholder on your bike.\n\n## Location\n\nWe\u2019re a three hour drive from snow, a train ride away from the beach, and an hour\u2019s drive over a beautiful\nbridge from the tallest trees in the world. We\u2019ve got not one, but two huge city parks. We\u2019re surrounded\nby water on three sides. The next state to the west of us is Hawaii. If this were Civilization, San Francisco\nwould be the Pope spot on the board.\n\nAnd we\u2019re small enough that no matter how drunk you get, you can walk home from anywhere else in the city.\n\n\n## Mission Dolores On Sunday Morning\n\nTake a walk over to Mission Dolores on a Sunday morning and you\u2019ll see a line-up of those little ice cream\ncarts waiting for church to get out. Hang out long enough that you can see the little kids running out of mass\nin their Sunday best to get their ice cream. That was the deal: \u201cYou come to mass and afterwards you can get\nice cream.\u201d \n\n## AT&T Park\n\nNot a bad seat in the house. Sit in the upper deck and face the Bay. Between pitches you can watch ships\npassing back and forth. And if Karl is agreeable you can see all the way to the Oakland hills. And there\u2019s\nbeen the occasional ring ceremony (but probably not this year).\n\n## Streetlight Records\n\nAmoeba\u2019s bigger. And has more stuff. But the people at Streetlight are friendly enough that when someone\ndrops off six boxes of records that have been sitting in their basement for twenty years, they\u2019ll let me go\nthrough them before putting them in the bins.\n\n## Our Fire Department\n\nMost of our buildings are old. And packed together. And made of wood. Many with horse hair insulation and\nelectrical systems that pre-date the gold rush. Just in the last year, three houses in my neighborhood have\ngone up in flames. And in every single case, the fire was contained in time to spare the houses on either\nside. Our fire department kicks ass.\n\n## Women\n\nBut women are pretty awesome anywhere.\n\n## We boom. We bust.\n\nMost of all, San Francisco is a survivor. It builds itself up, draws people to it, and then when it\u2019s had\nenough, it shakes them off. It celebrates the good times because it knows the bad times are probably around\nthe corner. And it makes it through the bad times because it knows the good times are coming. And it\u2019s happy\nto have you aboard, under Karl\u2019s protective blanket, and you\u2019ll do well here. As long as you remember the\nmain character in our story isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s the city itself. \n\n## Leaving is easy.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not here to convince you that my city is any better than yours. I hope you love where you live as\nmuch as I love where I live. Everyone should love where they live. But love isn\u2019t usually easy or free of\nmessiness. And great love never is.\n\nThe city isn\u2019t here to serve you.

I loved it. 20 years later, he\u2019s still there.<\/p><p>Anyone who was lazy or who he didn\u2019t like was \u2018a shower\u2019. Maric would beat Stanislavsky, Chekov and Gogol into disinterested South London kids with his sheer force of will. I was inspired by his passion and attitude; it wasn\u2019t something you saw in many teachers. <\/p><p>His \u2018department of one\u2019 was constantly on the verge of being shut down, so once a year he would stage plays like \u2018<cite>The Government Inspector<\/cite>\u2019 or \u2018<cite>Hiawatha<\/cite>\u2019. The big song and dance left the parents feeling warm and fuzzy about seeing their kids on stage, gave the management something to show off, but it was ultimately a survival tactic for theatre education itself.<\/p><p>As I reflect on where I am now, I\u2019ve come to see theatre as one of the most important things I did in school. Given the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/tto\/education\/article3722052.ece\">current climate<\/a>, I wonder if we\u2019re going to lose something if academic subjects have to prove their economic value, when what you learn is rather intangible. <\/p><p>Drama gave me the confidence to stand up in front of anyone and do anything \u2018in the name of art\u2019. I\u2019ve done a fair bit of performance since leaving school, including what I consider to be one of life\u2019s ultimate lessons: appearing naked on stage (my character lost a game of strip poker\u2026 but that\u2019s another story\u2026). <\/p><p>When you\u2019re performing, you enter a zone where the normal rules don\u2019t apply.

That raises the historical questions: how did it happen that Americans managed to seize such\n> freedom, conceive such ideals, achieve such success, yet grieve over such disappointment? Did they think\n> themselves somehow exempt from the curses of Adam and Eve?\n> A short answer can be had by conducting a thought experiment based on a popular 1990s computer game. The\n> player begins with an endowment of land, resources, and people, then plays God (or Caesar) in an effort to\n> build up a civilization. Imagine a continent, heavily forested, plentifully watered, fertile, rich in metals\n> and fossil resources, situated in the most benign latitudes of the north temperate zone. Imagine the continent\n> vacant but for a few million neolithic tribespeople scattered over thousands of miles and vulnerable to\n> diseases pandemic in the rest of the world. Imagine, too, a restless, advanced civilization across the sea,\n> whose own population is starting to soar. Now introduce on the coasts of your continent tens of thousands,\n> then millions of Britons, leavened by a mix of Germans, Frenchmen, and others, endowed with all the power,\n> ideas, and ambitions of the Renaissance, Protestant Reformation, and Scientific Revolution. Having imagined\n> all this, all you need do is cry \u201cLet the games begin!\u201d and you have your American Genesis.\n> That is the short answer. For the long answer you have to read on.\n\nRead the books.

What if an app\nupdates at a really inconvenient time?\n\nToday I was waiting in the subway tunnel for my Muni train. No Wi-Fi. I was all ready to start reading a book\non my Kindle app when I noticed the Kindle app was stuck in the middle of an update. __Oh no! Code red!\nHypothetical situation has become reality!!__\n\nI checked the status of the update in the App Store app and noticed there was an option to \u201cpause\u201d the\ndownload. I clicked the button and my Kindle app returned to normal. __Phew.__\n\nIn addition to automatic updates, there are a couple other nice features of iOS 7 such as the Control Center\nand the camera improvements. However, the thing that\u2019s got most people talking is the new design.\n\nI\u2019m not a designer so I\u2019m not going to get into the layout of the icons or the lack of shadows and bevels.\nI just wanted to note that I think the design is a huge improvement for developers.\n\nI downloaded Xcode 5 at the same time as iOS 7 so that I could start developing iOS 7 applications. I was\nreally impressed by how much better all the default styling and components look.\n\nI\u2019m super happy to see those ugly blue navigations bars and rounded rect buttons bite the dust. I\u2019m ready\nfor change and I\u2019m re-energized to build better looking iPhone apps with iOS 7.\n\nIt\u2019s also just fun to ask, \u201cso what\u2019s your tintColor?\u201d","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @leahculver on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/leah-culver\/23-06-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Leah Culver","slug":"leah-culver","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/leah-culver\/2013-june-23","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000059401048\/801586da67388f3184461a398ae6762f_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1371888000","date":"2013-june-22","nicedate":"Saturday, 22 June 2013","title":"","thought":"<h1>The Best Parenting Advice You Will Ever Get<\/h1><p>I am 30 years old and holding a urine-soaked stick with a pink line and freaking the fuck out. <\/p><p>The most amazing thing about that little tableau is that, unlike most of the stupid situations I\u2019ve found myself in during my less-than-model life, there are quite a few of you nodding along right now and thinking \u201cYep.

We were engaged and wanted a destination wedding: Turks and Caicos and Jamaica lost out to Key West in order to keep it more accessible for friends and family. It was going to be expensive and we didn\u2019t want to go into debt, so Cherrie lived and worked in NYC for about 6 months. (Partly just to see if she could do it, but also to earn more money. As the great philosopher Jay-Z once said \u201cAnd since I made it here, I can make it anywhere\u201d.) I worked 2 full-time jobs, one of which was my first job as a web designer for a small shop in St. Petersburg Beach, Florida.<\/p><p>There were two significant things that happened that led to why we wanted to run a conference: I attended the 2008 Future of Web Design Conference (which was in NYC in November) and Cherrie and I sadly had to fire our wedding planners about 2 months before our wedding, which was to be in February 2009. <\/p><p>FOWD was amazing. Being in a place with so many like-minded people and hearing stories from people that I had been learning from the past year blew my mind. It was my first conference and I came back completely inspired. I started looking for events like that a little closer to home but I didn\u2019t find much besides a BarCamp.<\/p><p>Meanwhile, we were having a really hard time maintaining communication with our planners in Key West and getting anything booked. We made the decision to lose the planners and have Cherrie take over. I really didn\u2019t do much except for agree to most of her awesome ideas. She put together a fantastic four days in Key West to celebrate with our friends and family. <\/p><p>All of a sudden it was all over and we had nothing to do except to live happily ever after.<\/p><p>Around that same time, Chris Coyier tweeted that he had just spoken to a high school class about web design. So, I pitched Cherrie on an idea. I still wanted a day in Florida to celebrate the web industry and the people who share their knowledge. Cherrie wanted to plan another event, even if it was for a bunch of my fellow web geeks. So, we agreed to give it a shot.<\/p><p>Here\u2019s how it went down.<\/p><p>I sent out a couple of awkward \u201cif you\u2019re not doing anything on this day in July, would you kind of maybe want to come to Florida and talk to people on stage\u201d DMs. Chris was the first to reply and the first to say yes. At that point, it was officially \u201con\u201d. I asked a few others that I had been learning from and also asked what they would want in order to be able to break away from work and travel here to do it. It was pretty consistent amongst everyone so we started planning and promoting.<\/p><p>Twitter was still relatively focused at the time and I had gotten in early with the completely appropriate handle of \u201cwebdesignfanboy\u201d. Since I was early enough and it was clear what I was about, I gained some traction in the follower realm. We relied on Twitter and the blog posts that the speakers wrote for about 97.5% of the promotion. (We whipped up 100 promo post cards and sent them to Florida web design shops as well.) One of my favorite things is that I had recently discovered Ricardo Gimenes and I hired him to do characters for the speakers. He rocks and they were so much fun.<\/p><p>Cherrie said yes to running the conf in March and we ran it on July 31st. We had 7 speakers: Fabio Sasso, Grant Friedman, Jonathan Longnecker, Chris Coyier, John Ashenden, Andrew Maier and Kevin Hale. We were fortunate to have some helpful sponsors and 92 people got to see me nearly pass out from stage fright as I stumbled through welcoming everyone and introducing Fabio.<\/p><p>It was stressful, but totally exhilarating. The speakers absolutely rocked and I was awestruck the whole day. When the presentations were over, Eric Azares sealed the deal on us running another one by walking up and asking if he could buy a ticket for the next one.<\/p><p>Running an event for the first time and putting it together in a few months meant that it wasn\u2019t very efficient, so it cost us a good chunk of cash. It was totally worth it, though, as it started me down a path of front-end development and Cherrie as an event planner. I have personally had so many wonderful opportunities come from it and I now work with the rad folks at Envy Labs. I try to pay back the time Cherrie spends on it by helping with her other events throughout the year, but I\u2019m still in debt in that category.<\/p><p>It\u2019s a lot of work each year, but the benefits outweigh the work so much that it\u2019s not even a factor. We have met so many wonderful people and formed awesome friendships. It\u2019s almost starting to feel like a reunion with friends that we may have not gotten to see much throughout the year. We are sharing knowledge and celebrating community and it is absolutely fantastic. My absolute favorite part has been seeing people progress in skill and in their career path.  <\/p><p>Running a conference isn\u2019t for everyone, but there is definitely something that you want to do that feels intimidating. Dive in after it. Good things will come. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be celebrating you and our community in a couple of days.

At that point, it was officially \u201con\u201d.

Since I was early enough and it was clear what I was about, I gained some traction in the follower realm. We relied on Twitter and the blog posts that the speakers wrote for about 97.5% of the promotion. (We whipped up 100 promo post cards and sent them to Florida web design shops as well.) One of my favorite things is that I had recently discovered Ricardo Gimenes and I hired him to do characters for the speakers.

I have personally had so many wonderful opportunities come from it and I now work with the rad folks at Envy Labs.

Cheers!<\/p>","thought_markdown":"\n\nWe all see inspirational quotes so often that they are nearly clich\u00e9. One of my favorites is \u201cGood things\ncome to those who hustle.\u201d So I thought I could share a timely story that helps back that one up.\n\nWe\u2019re coming up on our fifth time running the [Front-End Design Conference](http:\/\/frontendconf.com) in St.\nPetersburg, Florida. A question that I get asked often is \u201chow did you start your first conference?\u201d.\n\nThe most important things to know are \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d, which are both intermingled from life\nexperiences that my (now) wife Cherrie and I had in the year before the event. We were engaged and wanted a\ndestination wedding: Turks and Caicos and Jamaica lost out to Key West in order to keep it more accessible for\nfriends and family. It was going to be expensive and we didn\u2019t want to go into debt, so Cherrie lived and\nworked in NYC for about 6 months. (Partly just to see if she could do it, but also to earn more money. As the\ngreat philosopher Jay-Z once said \u201cAnd since I made it here, I can make it anywhere\u201d.) I worked 2\nfull-time jobs, one of which was my first job as a web designer for a small shop in St. Petersburg Beach,\nFlorida.\n\nThere were two significant things that happened that led to why we wanted to run a conference: I attended the\n2008 Future of Web Design Conference (which was in NYC in November) and Cherrie and I sadly had to fire our\nwedding planners about 2 months before our wedding, which was to be in February 2009. \n\nFOWD was amazing. Being in a place with so many like-minded people and hearing stories from people that I had\nbeen learning from the past year blew my mind. It was my first conference and I came back completely inspired.\nI started looking for events like that a little closer to home but I didn\u2019t find much besides a BarCamp.\n\nMeanwhile, we were having a really hard time maintaining communication with our planners in Key West and\ngetting anything booked. We made the decision to lose the planners and have Cherrie take over. I really\ndidn\u2019t do much except for agree to most of her awesome ideas. She put together a fantastic four days in Key\nWest to celebrate with our friends and family. \n\nAll of a sudden it was all over and we had nothing to do except to live happily ever after.\n\nAround that same time, Chris Coyier tweeted that he had just spoken to a high school class about web design.\nSo, I pitched Cherrie on an idea. I still wanted a day in Florida to celebrate the web industry and the people\nwho share their knowledge. Cherrie wanted to plan another event, even if it was for a bunch of my fellow web\ngeeks. So, we agreed to give it a shot.\n\nHere\u2019s how it went down.\n\nI sent out a couple of awkward \u201cif you\u2019re not doing anything on this day in July, would you kind of maybe\nwant to come to Florida and talk to people on stage\u201d DMs. Chris was the first to reply and the first to say\nyes.

The curious, critical and analytical mind that carried me through a PhD and\nthen helped me forge a new career in web design has turned on itself, picking apart my every endeavour and\ndeed.\n\nI am not alone. It was recently reported that \u201c[one in four people suffer a mental health\nproblem](http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/commentisfree\/2013\/jun\/06\/one-in-four-mental-illness-organised)\u201d. I\u2019ll\nsay that again. One in four people. One quarter. 25%.\n\nDepression means many things to many people. It can have a variety of symptoms and a variety of causes. But\nfor all sufferers of depression the same thing is true \u2014 the part of your brain controlling perception is\nbroken. Sufferers receive the same information others receive but cannot process that information in the same\nway; your perception of the world is fundamentally distorted.\n\nDepression is an incredibly hard thing to talk about because talking openly about our frailties can be\nregarded as a weakness \u2014 or worse, a failure (most crucially by ourselves). But the first step in managing\ndepression is knowing it and to do this we must open up to somebody: whether that is a loved one, a medical\nprofessional or a complete stranger. So I\u2019m opening up to you.\n\nI want to take this opportunity \u2014 this privileged platform \u2014 to share with you that depression is not a\nweakness; we need to be able to talk openly about mental illness and accept that it is a condition which can\naffect anybody.

We can add a clause to this that suggests regularity \u2014 someone who programs often is a programmer. That\u2019s all it takes to be a programmer. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve just started and worked your way through the fundamentals like control structures and taming functions. It doesn\u2019t matter if for some reason you don\u2019t feel like a programmer. It doesn\u2019t matter if someone pays you or not, unless you really find it important to be a professional programmer. If you program and you do it over and over, you become a programmer.<\/p><p>Last week I had the privilege of being amongst the speakers at <a href=\"http:\/\/2013.jsconf.us\">JSConf 2013<\/a>. The best part about this particular speaking opportunity was that I was able to give a non-technical talk about programming that I\u2019d wanted to give for a long time. It was a culmination of all the things regarding learning to program that I\u2019ve talked about here on The Pastry Box stitched together with further anecdotes and advice. It talked about cognitive biases and tried to convince people to get their biases out of the way so they could realize their potential. One of the slides in my presentation addressed impostor syndrome (known as impostor phenomenon in peer-reviewed, formal research) as it relates to the craft of programming, but really the point I was trying to make could be applied to anybody in any field.<\/p><p>Impostor phenomenon, explained simply, is the experience of feeling like a fraud (or impostor) while participating in communities of highly skilled participants even when you are of a level of competence to match those around you. Impostor phenomenon is highly correlated with individuals who are successful; arguably success here means success as perceived by others. The important thing to note is that this experience isn\u2019t isolated to people we perceive as experts, only that it is a counterintuitive notion: one might assume that as they develop their skills in a craft further that their confidence should increase and their insecurity about whether they are good and whether they belong would fade away. It turns out that this is not the case for a lot of people.<\/p><p>I found myself wondering if my talk was going to be all that useful to the people I perceived as experts; I questioned whether or not the smart people I admired that I knew would see it were going to find value in this thing that I had made to share with everyone.<\/p><p>I gave the talk, and afterwards several of them thanked me for that slide. Some of them my heroes, they took me aside and confided their thanks. They confided their relief. <\/p><p>In the end I wasn\u2019t shocked that the successful people I admired had experienced impostor phenomenon and talked to me about it \u2014 I was shocked that I somehow thought the people I see as heroes were somehow exempt from having it. I did the one thing I didn\u2019t want to do: make that assumption about anyone.<\/p><p>We\u2019re all just doing the best we know how to when it comes to programming, it\u2019s just that some people have more practice coming across as confident than others do.

Browsers have tended to do mostly the same thing, but have occasional, maddeningly unpredictable differences. For example, browsers all come with \u201cuser agent stylesheets\u201d \u2014 a default set of CSS styles, so that a heading looks like a heading etc., even before you style the page<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" class=\"footnote-jump\">1<\/a><\/sup>. Of course, every browser engine uses a slightly different set of defaults.<\/p><p>One example of this was <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/Guide\/CSS\/Consistent_list_indentation\">default list styles<\/a>, where Internet Explorer and Opera initially<sup><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"r2\" class=\"footnote-jump\">2<\/a><\/sup> indented lists with <code>margin-left: 30pt;<\/code> in their default browser stylesheets, while Firefox and KHTML went with <code>padding-left: 40px;<\/code>. If you wanted to change the default indent, specifying <code>ul {padding-left: 0;}<\/code> would lead to very different results across browsers.<\/p><h2>CSS resets<sup><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"r3\" class=\"footnote-jump\">3<\/a><\/sup><\/h2><p>To get a little stability, some developers reset all margins and padding using the universal selector:<\/p><pre><code>* {margin: 0; padding: 0;}<\/code><\/pre><p>With this at the start of your stylesheet, when you specified a list indent you got what you expected. However, using <code>*<\/code> meant the default margin and padding were nuked for <em>all<\/em> elements, which became painful as soon as you added a <code>&lt;form&gt;<\/code> element.<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/tantek.com\/log\/2004\/09.html#d06t2354\">Tantek \u00c7elik<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/meyerweb.com\/eric\/thoughts\/2004\/09\/15\/emreallyem-undoing-htmlcss\/\">Eric Meyer<\/a> started discussing a more targeted way to address user agent style differences in 2004, with the <a href=\"http:\/\/nate.koechley.com\/blog\/2006\/05\/09\/second-yui-release\/\">YUI CSS Reset<\/a> appearing in 2006, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/meyerweb.com\/eric\/thoughts\/2007\/04\/12\/reset-styles\/\">Meyer Reset<\/a> in 2007.<\/p><blockquote><p>The point of a reset is to zero out as much as possible \u2026 [and] to serve as a starting point for your own baseline styles \u2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/meyerweb.com\/eric\/thoughts\/2011\/01\/26\/reset-v2-0\/#comment-542624\">Eric Meyer<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Here\u2019s the first rule of <a href=\"http:\/\/meyerweb.com\/eric\/tools\/css\/reset\/\">Eric\u2019s current (v2.0) CSS Reset<\/a>:<\/p><pre><code>html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe,\r\n h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,\r\n a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code,\r\n del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,\r\n small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,\r\n b, u, i, center,\r\n dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,\r\n fieldset, form, label, legend,\r\n table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td,\r\n article, aside, canvas, details, embed, \r\n figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup, \r\n menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary,\r\n time, mark, audio, video {\r\n \tmargin: 0;\r\n \tpadding: 0;\r\n \tborder: 0;\r\n \tfont-size: 100%;\r\n \tfont: inherit;\r\n \tvertical-align: baseline;\r\n }\r\n &hellip;<\/code><\/pre><p>This resets several properties on many (but not all) elements back to the equivalent of plain text. Because only appropriate elements are reset, this avoids some of the problems of <code>* {margin: 0; padding: 0;}<\/code>. We can then define styles for these reset \u201cunstyled\u201d properties, safe in the knowledge we\u2019re building on a stable, cross-browser base. This \u201cunstyled\u201d styling also acts as a reminder to consciously set appropriate styles for these elements.<\/p><h2>Problems with CSS resets<\/h2><p>CSS resets have been a lifesaver, but especially with the rise of frameworks they are now often used as-is. For example, Eric assumed people would build on the reset styles he proposed, overriding them as appropriate, and version 1 of the Meyer Reset included this rule for a time:<\/p><pre><code>\/* remember to define focus styles! *\/\r\n :focus {\r\n \toutline: 0;\r\n }<\/code><\/pre><p>Sadly, not everyone did define focus styles, and Eric has removed this from v2.<\/p><p>Using a reset can also start to feel a little perverse. Resetting browser default styles does force us to deliberate on how each element should appear, helping ensure we use elements for their semantics and not their default styling. But for elements like <code>i<\/code> and <code>em<\/code> that\u2019s almost always the browser default style. Other default browser styles, like the text sizes for headings which used to be ridiculously large, have changed to become passable defaults. There\u2019s also the problem of someone wanting to use a reset HTML element after handoff, still with only the \u201cunstyled\u201d reset styles specified.<\/p><p>For me the main issue with resets is inheritance, leading to spam in your browser dev tools. When you\u2019re trying to track down a CSS problem on a deeply nested element in someone else\u2019s code, this does not help:<\/p><figure class=\"center\"><img class=\"framed\" src=\"http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/inspector-spam.png\" \/><figcaption>CSS reset rules repeating due to inheritance<\/figcaption><\/figure><h2>Normalize.css<\/h2><p>Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal have taken a different approach with <a href=\"http:\/\/necolas.github.io\/normalize.css\/\">Normalize.css<\/a>, \u201ca small CSS file that provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements\u201d. As with CSS resets it gives us a reliable cross-browser starting point \u2014 the main reason for using a reset in the first place \u2014 but the two approaches are philosophically different.<\/p><p>CSS resets override user agent styles to return many elements back to an \u201cunstyled\u201d state, a level foundation we can safely build upon. However, we then need to define styles for most elements before we can build with them. Normalize.css instead addresses only the inconsistencies between user agent default styles, choosing the most appropriate default where there are differences. We get a safe cross-browser foundation here too, but one that includes normalized user agent styles as basic building materials ready for use.

However, we then need to define styles for most elements before we can\nbuild with them. Normalize.css instead addresses only the inconsistencies between user agent default styles,\nchoosing the most appropriate default where there are differences. We get a safe cross-browser foundation here\ntoo, but one that includes normalized user agent styles as basic building materials ready for use. It\u2019s\nbasically a kind of an idealized, cross-browser version of CSS 2.1\u2019s [Default style\nsheet](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/CSS2\/sample.html). For both ways we then need to add our own overriding styles to\nbuild the view, but because the browser defaults remain with Normalize.css, in general fewer styles need to be\nadded.\n\nBecause the changes in Normalize.css are a lot more targeted, there isn\u2019t an inheritance cascade of\noverwritten rules in your browser\u2019s developer tools. Here\u2019s a simple `<ul>`: \u201cunstyled\u201d, with\nthe Meyer Reset, and with Normalize.css versions 1 and\n2:![img](http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/unstyled.png)An \u201cunstyled\u201d\nunordered list\nelement![img](http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/meyer-reset.png)Applying the Meyer\nReset![img](http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/normalize-v1.png)Applying\nNormalize.css v1![img](http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/normalize-v2.png)Applying\nNormalize.css v2\n\nYou can clearly see the difference in philosophy, with the Meyer Reset example appearing as two lines of plain\ntext with no margins, padding or bullets, while the Normalize.css examples are similar to the default styling.\nThe difference in the styles applied to this `<ul>` are also easy to see. \n\nHowever, these are not all the styles being applied to the `<ul>`. For comparison, here\u2019s the same\n\u201cunstyled\u201d screenshot, but with the user agent styles visible, in Firefox 21 and Opera Next 15:\n![img](http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/user-agent-styles-moz.png)Mozilla user\nagent\nstyles![img](http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/user-agent-styles-opera.png)Opera\nuser agent styles\n\n*This* is the CSS that we\u2019re resetting or normalizing. \n\nNormalize.css version 2 supports modern browsers plus IE 8, whereas version 1 also contains additional support\nfor legacy browsers like IE 6 and 7. These older browsers need more normalization, and this can have minor\ndisadvantages, for example the added vertical margins for the nested list in the Normalize.css v1 screenshot\nabove. This split into two versions is useful if you no longer need to provide old browsers with Grade A\nsupport, and also if you want to learn about old browser quirks.\n\nNormalize.css also helps correct some browser bugs, including \u201cdisplay settings for HTML5 elements,\ncorrecting `font-size` for preformatted text, SVG overflow in IE9, and many form-related bugs across browsers\nand operating systems\u201d. For example, the following CSS fixes WebKit issues with HTML5\u2019s new `<input\ntype=\"search\">` element:\n\n\t\/** * 1. Address `appearance` set to `searchfield` in\n\tSafari 5 and Chrome. * 2. Address `box-sizing` set to `border-box` in Safari 5 and Chrome *    (include `-moz`\n\tto future-proof). *\/ input[type=\"search\"] { -webkit-appearance: textfield; \/* 1 *\/ -moz-box-sizing:\n\tcontent-box; -webkit-box-sizing: content-box; \/* 2 *\/ box-sizing: content-box; }\n\nWithout it, WebKit\u2019s default use of `-webkit-appearance: searchfield;` for `type=\"search\"`\nprevents the styling of font, padding, border, and background properties on OS X and iOS, and gives buggy\nbehavior for the border property on Windows.\n\nAn added bonus is Normalize.css is heavily commented and\n[well-documented](https:\/\/github.com\/necolas\/normalize.css\/wiki\/), helping you learn why each rule is there.\nThis does make it noticeably longer than CSS resets, but when minified and Gzipped even the larger\nNormalize.css v1 is only 1KB.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile philosophically different to CSS resets like the Meyer Reset, Normalize.css is very much carrying on the\nsame tradition, continuing in the footsteps of Tantek and Eric. You might even already be using it \u2014 it\u2019s\na core part of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http:\/\/html5boilerplate.com\/),\n[Bootstrap](http:\/\/twitter.github.io\/bootstrap\/), and YUI\u2019s new [Pure](http:\/\/purecss.io\/base\/). \n\nUser agent stylesheets are converging, and hopefully one day we won\u2019t need to reset or normalize. There\u2019s\neven [a valid argument](http:\/\/snook.ca\/archives\/html_and_css\/no_css_reset\/) for not worrying about small\ndifferences between browsers (although being a Snook-level genius helps with that). But for now if you\u2019re\nusing a CSS reset, or nothing at all, [give Normalize.css a try](http:\/\/necolas.github.io\/normalize.css\/) on\nyour next project.\n\n## Addenda\n\n *   [[1]](#r1) You can see the user agent style sheets for\n[Mozilla](http:\/\/mxr.mozilla.org\/mozilla-release\/source\/layout\/style\/html.css),\n[WebKit](http:\/\/trac.webkit.org\/browser\/trunk\/Source\/WebCore\/css\/html.css), and [IE](http:\/\/www.iecss.com\/).\n[CSS2.1 User Agent Style Sheet Defaults](http:\/\/css-class.com\/test\/css\/defaults\/UA-style-sheet-defaults.htm)\nhighlights the differences across (older) browsers. These styles also include things like `style {display:\nnone;}` \u2014 try adding `style {display: block;}` to your CSS and see what happens.\n\n *  [[2]](#r2) Since then, all browsers have migrated to setting list indenting via `padding-left` or\n`padding-start`, with IE7 being the last IE browser to use `margin-left` for this.\n\n *   [[3]](#r3) For detailed background on the history of CSS resets, read [The History of CSS\nResets](http:\/\/sixrevisions.com\/css\/the-history-of-css-resets\/), by Michael Tuck.\n\n*My thanks to Eric Meyer and Nicolas Gallagher for their feedback on this article, and for these wonderful\ntools.*\n\n*Postscript:* While nuking margins and padding on all elements with `* {margin: 0; padding: 0;}` is gonna be a\nbad time, there is one universal selector-based reset you should still consider: `* {box-sizing:\nborder-box;}`. This changes padding and border to being part of an element\u2019s width, rather than additional\nto it.

Careers that allow us to be who we need ourselves to be. <\/p><p>Leslie Jensen-Inman, Untitled.<\/p>","thought_markdown":"\n\nI stood there, 18-inches away from Mark Rothko\u2019s work. At 12 years old, I allowed myself to be completely\nabsorbed by it. I allowed it to speak to me\u2014to tell me its story. Like many of Rothko\u2019s paintings, this\npiece was named \u201cUntitled\u201d so I had no guidance as to what to think or feel as I experienced the painting.\nI understood it in a way only I could because I brought my own history and my own expectations to the piece. I\nsaw in the painting what I needed to see.\n\nA few years ago, I was in the process of designing new business cards. I decided that I would include my name,\nmy title, my email address, and my Twitter handle. I started to layout the information and realized that I\ndidn\u2019t know what to put as my title. At the time, I was working as a professor at the university level, so I\ncould have put \u201cProfessor.\u201d But it seemed limiting\u2014I was doing so much more than *just* teaching. I was\nwriting, speaking, designing, and more. I struggled with finding a title that would capture who I was and what\nI did. So I designed my business cards without a title. \n\nIn our industry, we see a lot of titles like \u201cRockstar\u201d or \u201cNinja.\u201d Heck, I\u2019ve even used the title\n\u201cMaker of Awesomeness.\u201d Although, some people might actually think they are rock stars, I\u2019m not sure all\nwho wear this label truly believe they are. We are at a time and place in our industry where most of us do *a\nlot* of different things. We serve in many different roles. Our roles, like the fields of color in Rothko\u2019s\npainting have bled together. They now overlap. They have created new shapes. Job titles that once explained\nour neatly contained roles, no longer do because our roles are no longer neatly contained. It\u2019s no wonder we\nturn to titles like Rockstar, Ninja, and Maker of Awesomeness. We don\u2019t know how to describe our roles\nbecause our responsibilities are so varied.\n\nDesigners develop and Developers design. Most everyone is expected to write some sort of copy, but are all of\nus Writers? How do we encapsulate the vast diversity that each of us do in a title? How do we say \u201cjack of\nall trades\u201d on a business card without saying \u201cjack of all trades?\u201d\n\nIn our industry, we don\u2019t yet have the language that supports the change from specialist and\ncompartmentalist to generalist that has occurred. A specialist is a someone who has more expertise in one area\n*over* others. A compartmentalist is someone who has equal expertise in *only* one area. A generalist is\nsomeone who has *equal* expertise in most areas. \n\nMost hiring companies can\u2019t afford specialists, desire generalists, and will *die* with compartmentalists.\nIt\u2019s very challenging for teams to function when they are built with specialists and compartmentalists\nbecause only specific people can perform specific tasks. This becomes a problem when a team member gets sick,\ngoes on vacation, or leaves the team altogether. \n\nThe team is left asking: Who takes on their tasks? \n\nWhen life events such as these occur, projects get bottlenecked. Sometimes projects completely stall or fail.\nAlso, in a work environment with specialists and compartmentalists, during the lifecycle of a project there\nare often times when some members of the team sit idle while other team members are pulling intense hours.\nHowever, when a team is made of generalists, bottlenecking is less likely to happen because team members are\nable to perform any and all of the tasks needed to get a project done. Hiring companies need generalists not\nto survive, but to thrive.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s easy to create a job title for a specialist or compartmentalist because either type of person\nreally only holds one role at one time, generalists are who companies need. On the other hand, it\u2019s\nchallenging to create a job title for a generalist because they hold many roles at one time. With hiring\ncompanies moving towards hiring generalists, it\u2019s easier to find a job as a generalist but more difficult to\nfind a job title. \n\nUntil we have the language that supports the change from specialist and compartmentalist to generalist, maybe\nwe go \u201cUntitled.\u201d Maybe, like Rothko\u2019s paintings, we embrace the changing shape of our fields. Maybe we\nallow them to bleed and to blend. Maybe we allow them to take the shape they need to take in order to create\nthe masterpieces held within our industry. \n\n\u201cUntitled.\u201d What if we allow ourselves to be seen by other people in ways similar to Rothko\u2019s paintings?\nWhen people get close to us and engage with us, they bring their own history and expectations to us. They see\nin us what they need to see. We are to them, what they need us to be. Since we are generalists, we are able to\nlive authentic untitled careers. Careers that allow us to be what each person we engage with need us to be.\nCareers that allow us to be who we need ourselves to be. \n\nLeslie Jensen-Inman, Untitled.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @jenseninman on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/leslie-jensen-inman\/25-05-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Leslie Jensen-Inman","slug":"leslie-jensen-inman","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/leslie-jensen-inman\/2013-may-25","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2920389624\/fc1dfb64eaf1d0ec24502ca528859930_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1369382400","date":"2013-may-24","nicedate":"Friday, 24 May 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>Form-making gets a lot of attention today.<\/p><p>The new forms are what people talk about.

You start next week\u2026now what? Here are ten tips to help you survive your first year on the job and come across as the earnest young go-getter that you are.<\/p><ol><li><p>Say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d Learn everyone\u2019s name. Talk to everyone in the office. Look people in the eye. Hold the door for others. Shake hands firmly. Be gracious. Smile. The quickest way to gain a reputation as a nice person to work with is to be a nice person to work with. This not only applies to interactions with co-workers, but also with receptionists, restaurant staff, office janitors, etc.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Be proactive and anticipate needs. Look for opportunities to fill gaps. Don\u2019t sit around waiting for someone to tell you what to do. Step up.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Don\u2019t avoid meetings. In fact, ask to sit in on as many as you can. It\u2019s a chance to show your face to people who have no idea who you are. It\u2019s also a chance to receive news first-hand, and to observe how your managers and co-workers communicate with each other and with clients. Don\u2019t avoid happy hours either.

At some point during the interview you\u2019ll be asked \u201cDo you have any questions\nfor us?\u201d You should have some. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to work here?\u201d is a dumb question. \u201cI notice a lot of your work is in editorial, do\nyou worry about the economics of that market?\u201d gets you a second interview.\n\n *  __Dress the part, be the part__\n\nThere is a school of thought that says your brilliance will shine through even if you\u2019re wearing a ratty\nhoodie and a stained t-shirt. It\u2019s stupid. You\u2019re gonna get some graduation money. Spend it on some decent\nclothes to wear to your interview. Your Flickr-stalking\/research should tell you whether a suit will impress\nor terrify your prospective employers.\n\nDon\u2019t hug any of your interviewers. Before *or* after.\n\n *  __Not to be a self-serving douchebag, but\u2026__\n\n[Read my book](http:\/\/www.abookapart.com\/products\/design-is-a-job). I wrote it just for you. It\u2019s got a ton\nof good lessons that will guide you through your career. Trust me on this. It\u2019s $18.00.\n\n *  __Don\u2019t apply at Facebook__\n\nSeriously, do you think so little of the sacrifice your parents made sending you to college that you\u2019re\nwilling to just throw your life away?","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @Mike_FTW on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/mike-monteiro\/20-05-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Mike Monteiro","slug":"mike-monteiro","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/mike-monteiro\/2013-may-20","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000855463905\/6cb24344f41440604a9f0a6fd0f1f92e_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1368950400","date":"2013-may-19","nicedate":"Sunday, 19 May 2013","title":"","thought":"<h1>On design writing<\/h1><p>Guidance about design is often situated in other disciplines.

How\u2019s the\n> water?\u201d And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other\n> and goes \u201cWhat the hell is water?\u201d\n\nIn his singular, electric, messy human way, he digs away at the same \u201ccapital-T Truth\u201d that the Five\nRecollections are getting at. That we have to keep reminding ourselves, over and over of what is hidden in\nplain sight all around us, all the time.\n\nThe fifth and final recollection is different from the rest. No adaptation necessary.\n\n\u201cI am the owner of my actions, heir to my actions, and supported by my actions.

That\u2019s cool, except that this is the 21st century, and the single-space convention\nwas adopted by publishers many years ago. I challenge you to open any modern book, newspaper, or magazine, and\nobserve what you see.\n\nAre you typesetting a book that emulates the look of the original Sherlock Holmes novels? Sure, go ahead and\nuse the double-space. Are you designing a poster that\u2019s meant to look like Peggy Olson\u2019s copy for \u201cThe\nRejuvenator\u201d? Fill your boots, I say! In these cases, designing with the double-space can be used as an\nextra detail to bring more authenticity and reflect the period in which it would have appeared.\n\nBut guys, I\u2019m begging you. It\u2019s 2013. Why would you waste valuable Twitter characters on such a useless\nthing? Try to break the bad habit, okay?","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @hellogeri on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/geri-coady\/11-05-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Geri Coady","slug":"geri-coady","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/geri-coady\/2013-may-11","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000544460969\/a693c4c3b0ca5498bbe3266ff00bc340_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1368172800","date":"2013-may-10","nicedate":"Friday, 10 May 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>I made a website the other day.

If only these packet-designing fools had one ounce of common sense. <\/p><p>Never mind that lady over there in the white shirt who opened three in a row without incident. Never mind that I was able to open the second packet with no trouble.

What mustard really needs is more thoughtful packaging. I\u2019m thinking a little nested box made from shredded tires and bent road signs. Inside the packet lies on a bed of dried hemp.

I found this exceptionally useful as a kind of lower-bound I could put on my skills and knowledge; I could say that there were topics I could move forward from and thus move towards more advanced material with confidence. This month, I\u2019m baking a cookie about how I know that I\u2019m not a master at programming. In fact, I\u2019d even go as far to say that there are no masters.<\/p><p>There is no such thing as a grand ultimate master of programming because the goalposts will always keep moving. If we were to take the top ten percent of programmers, we could say that those programmers are probably experts. We would still have the problem of defining what criteria includes people in that ten percent, which is an altogether different matter. But a master? The term \u2018master\u2019 in the context of ability is usually reserved for someone who has studied an art or science so thoroughly that they have complete knowledge and skill over said art or science. When it comes to programming, there are no masters because the landscape of programming changes dramatically as new technology is forged.<\/p><p>There are always new tools. There will be new languages. The hardware will change. The software will have to adapt. You will have to change. You will have to adapt.<\/p><p><strong>Sign of Programmer Expertise #1:<\/strong> The programmer understands that the learning will never stop and is at peace with how quickly the tools and landscape change.<\/p><p>The expert who you look up to \u2014 you know the one, they\u2019ve written that sweet library you use so much, and you\u2019ve read all of their books \u2014 cannot and should never halt on the notion that they have achieved mastery. Programming will move on without them. Maybe they\u2019ll have mastered programming circa the year 2013, but the rest of us will go on without them if they stop there.<\/p><p>So what about that top ten percent? We know it is unrealistic to say we will be masters of this domain. We made peace with that at the end of the last paragraph. How do we approach criteria that describes someone as an expert programmer? The dialogue is ongoing, and I hope that through it we\u2019ll eventually be able to convey to those who want to learn programming the kind of expectations they have to meet to be the best of the best.<\/p><p><strong>Sign of Programmer Expertise #2:<\/strong> If you are an expert at programming, in at least one language you must be able to code as though you have a gun to your head, without a language reference.<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\" class=\"footnote-jump\">*<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p>I know what you\u2019re thinking, that most programmers always have a browser tab open with an API or language reference. Nobody actually codes without at least some of that stuff in their day-to-day job. I know I do. This makes sense for when you are trying to make something for someone else and you are on a budget of time, money, or both. Often it makes sense for you personally too, when you\u2019re on your own time making your own wonderful thing. Because you value your time, you want to have all the resources you need so that you don\u2019t have to remember the name of a function that you\u2019ve forgotten while you remember the essence of what that function is supposed to do. You want to accomplish building something for yourself in a reasonable amount of time.<\/p><p>This is good for building things and shipping them, but what it\u2019s not good for is your mastery of programming.<\/p><p>This may seem in direct contradiction to what I said last month. In my last pastry, I explained that you have to be able to program in different languages than the one you are most comfortable with to say that you really know programming and not just the language. This is true. However, this is like saying that if you are learning to swing a sword, you should be able to use almost any sword.

On my slice of the internet, the sum of our reactions to a string of awful,\nnervewracking events was a deafening howl of anger, dramatic opinion, blame, defensiveness, and so on. \n\nBut there were also essential things. Friends in Boston sent reassuring messages while a manhunt went on in\ntheir neighborhoods. Verified reports from journalists in Massachusetts and Texas arrived to clarify\nconfusions and replace speculation with fact. When things are rough, it\u2019s certainly possible to turn the\ncomputer off and walk away, but with so many of my people online, it\u2019s also where I go for comfort and\nconnection.\n\nSo in the last week, I\u2019ve thought a lot about what I might do as a listener and a speaker on the internet to\ntry to preserve the good while saving my head and heart from the worst of the shouting.\n\nThis is a very sketchy first draft, but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve come up with so far. \n\n## Edit the outgoing channelThe only thing I can directly control is what I say. My instincts aren\u2019t\nalways trustworthy in moments of intense anxiety, so I\u2019ve tried to make myself a little list of what to do:\nampify emergency relief information, pass along ways to volunteer; send brief words of comfort; do very little\nelse. \n\n## Filter the incoming channelI don\u2019t like what anger and fear\u2014mine and others\u2019\u2014do to my brain\nand my body, so I filter like crazy:\n\n *  __Twitter muting:__ I use clients that allow keyword and user muting, ideally for set durations. I mute\nspecific keywords, hashtags, and people, especially when something crazy happens in the world. It\u2019s a\nprivate, non-judgy way for me to keep following people I like but whose responses to crisis events is too loud\nfor my addled brain to handle. (I use TweetBot on iOS and YoruFukurou on the Mac, and I hear good things about\nJanetter for Windows and Android.)\n\n *  __Twitter blocking:__ I\u2019m fine with opinion that sharply differs from mine, but only when it\u2019s civil.\nI block strangers who appear in my stream yelling at me. I block people who regularly enjoy trolling, and I\nmute their usernames as keywords so I don\u2019t see hate-retweets. (And I turn off retweets for people who do a\nlot of hate-retweeting.) I even block people who abuse my friends online. I block a lot. It helps.\n\n *  __Editorial trolling:__ On the web, I use host files to prevent blind links from directing me to sites\nthat exist to troll us. If someone links to a piece on Gawker or Slate, my computer hits a nice blank page\ninstead of the article, giving me a chance to realize that I\u2019d really rather not. This is how I [edit my\nHosts file](http:\/\/decoding.wordpress.com\/2009\/04\/06\/how-to-edit-the-hosts-file-in-mac-os-x-leopard\/) on the\nMac. Windows users can do a version of the same thing, and there are also plug-ins for FireFox and Chrome that\nblock sites, if you don\u2019t feel like messing around with the command line.\n\n *  __Comments:__ It\u2019s easy to say \u201cdon\u2019t read the comments,\u201d but it\u2019s a lot of work for the brain\nto ignore words that appear at the bottom of an article.

Is the fear of missing\nout such a compelling reason to not give thoughtful consideration to the wonderful person in front of you?\n\n\nI see your eyes, they\u2019re glancing at that screen. \n\nNotifications should be nonintrusive and passive rather than the other name we give them: alerts. Your friend\nposting a photo of their coffee or updating their existential state of being is, nine times out of ten, not\nearth-shattering news. \n\n *  __Safety__\n\nThis is a practical and an important point. Smartphones are expensive. Smartphones are easy targets for\nthieves. I\u2019ve seen phones snatched from submerged owners or even casual tourists walking around the city\nlooking at Google Maps. It\u2019s a shame that we live in a time when private property isn\u2019t respected and that\nthievery exists, but it does. Don\u2019t be the person who\u2019s shouting, \u201cHey! That\u2019s my phone!\u201d while\nchasing someone rapidly through the streets of the city.\n\nOr that person with their head down and BAM! Hello, tree\/light pole\/other pedestrian. \n\nThen there\u2019s the ridiculous looking-at-your-phone-while-crossing-the-street individuals. Fancy being hit by\na car? I certainly don\u2019t. As my dad is fond of saying when people seem reckless with their lives, \u201cSo\nfatalistic!\u201d \n\nWhen I was a teenager and then in my early 20s, the only way to get in touch with someone was by picking up a\nphone and purposely calling them. It made the connection deeper in comparison \u2014 hearing the quality of their\nvoice and tone. And before three-way calling or call waiting, you were locking the phone down for just one\nperson at a time. I recall scrambling for coins or phone cards to call friends at pay phones when I wanted to\nhear their voice or bug them or just catch up. \n\nAbsence makes the heart grow fonder. Fondness is all I seek.\n\nI\u2019m not advocating to go back to those times, believe me. I am advocating for basic norms of respect for the\npeople around you. \n\nLet\u2019s respect each other, engage and be in the moment. Let us enjoy the presence of each other\u2019s company\nand use the absence of technology to get into a conversation. Practice your speaking skills. Enjoy the moment\n\u2014 your moments. The quiet, the people watching, taking in your surroundings and letting things happen to you\nrather than turning your brain to the ON position all the time. OFF isn\u2019t an idle matter \u2014 it\u2019s a state\nof being.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @weightshift on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/naz-hamid\/23-04-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Naz Hamid","slug":"naz-hamid","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/naz-hamid\/2013-april-23","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3495438398\/f8cc7227ba86d67cb26e1d86e8e9d8a6_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1366617600","date":"2013-april-22","nicedate":"Monday, 22 April 2013","title":"","thought":"<h1>Quaker Mode<\/h1><p>I don\u2019t really know shit about Quakers.

It was clear that something had changed, but it was hard for me to articulate what it was; not only\nthat, I felt noticeably happier. Without realizing it, I had found a way for me to maintain my \u201cflow\u201d at\nwork.\n\nFlow meaning my actual mental state: I was in my zone, designing like time didn\u2019t exist, food didn\u2019t need\nto be eaten, and all the puzzle pieces were snapping into place. It was a luxury that I tried to ration to\nmyself for fear of becoming an unsocial hermit. It was a state fostered by a complex web of factors, all\ncontributing to my ability to find my optimal state: being highly challenged and having the skills to meet\nthose challenges without interference. It wasn\u2019t entirely obvious to me at the time, but things like having\na solid organizational infrastructure, working with a supportive team and reporting to management who\nchampioned my need to succeed all helped contribute to my happiness. Overall it was a cultural system that\nempowered me to seek my own challenges and face them uninterrupted.\n\nI didn\u2019t know this was an actual recognized psychological state until I watched a documentary called\n[Happy](http:\/\/www.thehappymovie.com\/), where I was introduced to the positive psychology concepts of Mih\u00e1ly\nCs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi. Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi doesn\u2019t just recognize my flow, he says it contributes to happiness.\nThis perfect storm of factors actually contributed to me feeling very content.\n\n[![img](http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Flow-SamanthaWarren-882x1024.jpg)](http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Flow-SamanthaWarren.jpg)\n\nWhile flow had previously been an achievable mental state while working on personal projects, painting, or\ngardening, I am not sure I truly had found a sustainable state at work. Contrary to popular belief there is no\nrecipe for the perfect environment for a designer. I have had conversations with friends who swear that\nexposed brick and hip furniture make them feel more creative. Others feel inspired when they can dress however\nthey want.  \n\nBoth process and culture are the two most underrated topics in the design industry. They form the\ninfrastructure that can make or break a project; it dictates how teams work together, how communication is\nperformed, and how a designer finds their flow against all challenges that face them in creating a solution.\nWe talk about innovation, but how do we build the systems that breed it?\n\nWatch [Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi\u2019s Ted talk on\nFlow](http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow.html).","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @SamanthaToy on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/samantha-warren\/18-04-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Samantha Warren","slug":"samantha-warren","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/samantha-warren\/2013-april-18","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000168612598\/e0686e9a8659cfecedd23b6a6d5b9e55_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1366185600","date":"2013-april-17","nicedate":"Wednesday, 17 April 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>Failure is the new success.

But I\u2019m surprised at how widespread the misunderstanding of terms. Many people I talk to, when this subject comes up, still essentially have this understanding:<\/p><blockquote><p>introvert = shy nerd = bad <br \/>extrovert = cool jock = good<\/p><\/blockquote><p><strong>This is untrue<\/strong> and a bit harmful if you ask me. I\u2019m highly introverted. But I\u2019m not particularly shy, or a shut-in, or whatever other negative stereotypes we could lump on.<\/p><p>The truth about the difference between introverts and extroverts lies in how personal energy is used and gained. Introverts need a lot of recharging time to gain energy. Being out-and-about, especially in social situations, is draining. Alone time is the only way to get that energy back. For me, it\u2019s a lot of alone time. Not sitting in a dark cave staring at the wall, but somewhere comfortable where I can do other activities I enjoy. Laying on a hotel bed catching up on the internet totally counts. At home cooking dinner totally counts. Even reading a book at a coffee shop counts.<\/p><p>Extroverts are the opposite in that they gain energy from social interactions.

Now, I could\ngive a rat\u2019s ass about someone unfollowing me, but the fact that he felt inclined to write a post about it,\ncoupled with the fact that I was stuck in coach for six hours unleashed the asshole within.\n\nI started a fight with the guy, he engaged, and before I knew it I\u2019d worked up a scheme where I was trying\nto get him to 1000 followers by the end of my flight, (He had maybe 100 to start with.) with the sole purpose\nof getting all those new followers to unfollow him the next day at the same time. \n\nThe next day I looked over this guy\u2019s reply stream and it was full of hate and vitriol and name calling. I\nfelt sick. I was responsible for that. I worked people into a frenzy and urged them to pick on this guy.\n\nI did something stupid and behaved like a bully. I punched down.\n\nWhy am I bringing this up now? Because it was probably the shittiest thing I\u2019ve ever done online. And people\nlet me know it. I was called names. I was told I did a terrible thing. And I deserved it. And it was fair.\n\n\nIt was a measured response. \n\nI want to be a better person. For the sake of the people around me. For the sake of my son. For my own\nwell-being and happiness. I want to treat others the way I hope they would treat me. Sadly, I know myself too\nwell. I\u2019m going to fall short of that goal on a lot of days. And to varying degrees, we all will. And when I\ndo I\u2019ll deserve to be called out. I\u2019ll deserve to be called names. I\u2019ll deserve to be insulted.\n\nBut we all deserve a measured response.\n\nBecause when your response is worse than the action that elicits it, then who\u2019s the asshole?","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @Mike_FTW on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/mike-monteiro\/26-03-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Mike Monteiro","slug":"mike-monteiro","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/mike-monteiro\/2013-march-26","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000855463905\/6cb24344f41440604a9f0a6fd0f1f92e_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1364198400","date":"2013-march-25","nicedate":"Monday, 25 March 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>It\u2019s March and this is the month I turn a year older.

Actually, it\u2019s more accurate to say that I\u2019m <em>trying<\/em> to buy a new car. You see, I went to my local Mini dealership with a very clear idea of what I wanted and what I had to spend, and came to an agreement on a new car\u2026and yet here I am more than two weeks later, still driving my 6-year-old Volkswagen with no clear timeframe of when that\u2019ll change. So what happened?<\/p><p>Not so fast. First, let\u2019s look at the process of buying a car. Buying a car follows a relatively predictable arc. You do your research, you find a model you like, you go to the dealership, you test drive a car or two, you decide on features, you work out financing. Hopefully they have your car on the lot, and you drive it home. If not, they find one at another dealer and get it there in a few days. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work. Worst case scenario, this takes a week. At least this was my expectation.<\/p><p>Got it? OK. Now let\u2019s look at the process of selling a car. Selling a car is a lot like fishing. A fisherman casts his bait, waits for a nibble, sets the hook, and reels the fish in. <em>Quickly<\/em>. Once the fisherman senses a hint of commitment, there\u2019s tremendous urgency to the process. The point is, once a buyer is ready to buy, the salesperson needs to <em>close the deal<\/em>. There are tens of thousands of dollars at stake in a car purchase and fierce competition for those dollars. It\u2019s not much of a stretch to say that sales people need to sell cars to stay alive. At least this was my expectation.<\/p><p>Now that we\u2019re all on the same page, here\u2019s what actually happened (the names have been changed to protect the innocent):<\/p><p><strong>Monday, March 4:<\/strong> I enter Mini of Pittsburgh at approximately 9:30am with a mission: I am going to buy a 2013 Mini Countryman S. I know what colors I like. I know what features I care about. I know what I can afford. I know what my trade-in is worth. I know what other cars I\u2019m considering. <em>I am ready to swallow the bait. I am ready to be reeled in<\/em>.<\/p><p>I am greeted by Justin, my salesman. Justin is a bald, spectacled, stubbly fellow, not unlike myself. Justin compliments my jacket. I like Justin. Justin and I sit down to discuss features. Justin and I test drive a few models. Justin and I return to the dealership to talk business. Justin introduces me to Carl, the sales manager. Carl and I come to an agreement on payments. Carl has me fill out a credit application. Justin and Carl and I shake hands. I leave the dealership, confident I\u2019ll soon be driving a new 2013 Mini Countryman S.<\/p><p><strong>Tuesday, March 5:<\/strong> Good news! My credit has been approved. Bad news! My desired vehicle is not in the dealership\u2019s inventory, so they\u2019ll need to locate one. A \u201clocate,\u201d that\u2019s what they call it. I am led to believe that a locate takes a few hours, maybe a day, and from that point it\u2019s another 10\u201314 days before the car actually arrives. Hmm.<\/p><p><strong>Wednesday, March 6:<\/strong> Justin emails me to say that they\u2019ve found a few vehicles that match my desired car. They\u2019re \u201cmoving forward with the locate.\u201d<\/p><p><strong>Thursday, March 7:<\/strong> I call Justin, inquiring on the status of my locate. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we got one,\u201d he says. \u201cPretty sure?\u201d I ask. \u201cPretty sure,\u201d he says. I am not so sure. Justin says he\u2019ll call me the next day.<\/p><p><strong>Friday, March 8:<\/strong> Justin does not call me.<\/p><p><strong>Saturday, March 9:<\/strong> My wife and I visit the dealership unannounced. Justin is busy with other customers, so we pass the time by taking another test drive. Upon our return, we bump into Carl. Carl barely recognizes me. I jog his memory. Carl asks if they ever located my car. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d I say. (SPOILER ALERT: they never located my car.) We sit down in Carl\u2019s office to properly locate my car. He gives me three options; I choose one at a Mini dealership in Louisville, Kentucky. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck. I know the sales manager in Louisville,\u201d Carl says. Carl is confident he\u2019ll have news for me by the end of the day. The end of the day passes. I hear nothing from Carl.<\/p><p><strong>Monday, March 11:<\/strong> It\u2019s midday. I have still heard nothing from Carl. I email him. Carl replies that he has no news, but a few hours later, he emails again. \u201cI got it!!\u201d he writes, with double exclamation points. \u201cGreat!!\u201d I reply, with double exclamation points, \u201cdo you need anything from me to make it official?\u201d Carl does not respond.<\/p><p><strong>Tuesday, March 12:<\/strong> Justin calls to confirm that yes, the locate has been completed, and no, they don\u2019t need anything further from me. I ask if he knows when my car will be picked up. He does not. I ask if he knows the route of the truck picking up my car. He does not. I ask if he\u2019s in contact with the truck driver. He is not. (SIDENOTE: it\u2019s 20-goddamn-13. This truck should be a real-time dot on a map, but I digress.) All Justin knows is that my 2013 Mini Countryman S will be here in 10\u201314 days and that once it arrives I will be \u201cthe second person to know.\u201d He\u2019ll be the first, you see.<\/p><p>[Eight days pass]<\/p><p><strong>Wednesday, March 20:<\/strong> The phone rings early in the morning. I recognize the number; it\u2019s Mini of Pittsburgh. I answer, breathlessly anticipating what is no doubt news of my car\u2019s arrival. Instead, it\u2019s Justin \u201cjust checking in,\u201d telling me the same thing he told me eight days ago: yes, my car\u2019s still definitely on the way, and no, he still doesn\u2019t know when, and no, he still doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s been picked up yet, and no, he still doesn\u2019t know where the truck is.

Actually, it\u2019s more accurate to say that I\u2019m <em>trying<\/em> to buy a new car. You see, I went to my local Mini dealership with a very clear idea of what I wanted and what I had to spend, and came to an agreement on a new car\u2026and yet here I am more than two weeks later, still driving my 6-year-old Volkswagen with no clear timeframe of when that\u2019ll change. So what happened?<\/p><p>Not so fast. First, let\u2019s look at the process of buying a car. Buying a car follows a relatively predictable arc. You do your research, you find a model you like, you go to the dealership, you test drive a car or two, you decide on features, you work out financing. Hopefully they have your car on the lot, and you drive it home. If not, they find one at another dealer and get it there in a few days. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work. Worst case scenario, this takes a week. At least this was my expectation.<\/p><p>Got it? OK. Now let\u2019s look at the process of selling a car. Selling a car is a lot like fishing. A fisherman casts his bait, waits for a nibble, sets the hook, and reels the fish in. <em>Quickly<\/em>. Once the fisherman senses a hint of commitment, there\u2019s tremendous urgency to the process. The point is, once a buyer is ready to buy, the salesperson needs to <em>close the deal<\/em>. There are tens of thousands of dollars at stake in a car purchase and fierce competition for those dollars. It\u2019s not much of a stretch to say that sales people need to sell cars to stay alive. At least this was my expectation.<\/p><p>Now that we\u2019re all on the same page, here\u2019s what actually happened (the names have been changed to protect the innocent):<\/p><p><strong>Monday, March 4:<\/strong> I enter Mini of Pittsburgh at approximately 9:30am with a mission: I am going to buy a 2013 Mini Countryman S. I know what colors I like. I know what features I care about. I know what I can afford. I know what my trade-in is worth. I know what other cars I\u2019m considering. <em>I am ready to swallow the bait. I am ready to be reeled in<\/em>.<\/p><p>I am greeted by Justin, my salesman. Justin is a bald, spectacled, stubbly fellow, not unlike myself. Justin compliments my jacket. I like Justin. Justin and I sit down to discuss features. Justin and I test drive a few models. Justin and I return to the dealership to talk business. Justin introduces me to Carl, the sales manager. Carl and I come to an agreement on payments. Carl has me fill out a credit application. Justin and Carl and I shake hands. I leave the dealership, confident I\u2019ll soon be driving a new 2013 Mini Countryman S.<\/p><p><strong>Tuesday, March 5:<\/strong> Good news! My credit has been approved. Bad news! My desired vehicle is not in the dealership\u2019s inventory, so they\u2019ll need to locate one. A \u201clocate,\u201d that\u2019s what they call it. I am led to believe that a locate takes a few hours, maybe a day, and from that point it\u2019s another 10\u201314 days before the car actually arrives. Hmm.<\/p><p><strong>Wednesday, March 6:<\/strong> Justin emails me to say that they\u2019ve found a few vehicles that match my desired car.

Justin is busy with other customers, so we pass the time by taking another test drive. Upon our return, we bump into Carl. Carl barely recognizes me. I jog his memory. Carl asks if they ever located my car. \u201cYou tell me,\u201d I say. (SPOILER ALERT: they never located my car.) We sit down in Carl\u2019s office to properly locate my car.

I am, as they say, doing well. Yet that book nearly did me in\u2014and not because of the writing, either. I was simply scared of being exposed. <\/p><p>I was terrified that the things I\u2019d been working on\u2014mostly alone, mostly in a little agency in Arizona that was far from perfect and that didn\u2019t really reflect what I wanted to be doing\u2014were going to get called out as minuscule and silly. That I didn\u2019t deserve to be doing this. That I\u2019d let people down. <\/p><p>I did it anyway. I felt nauseous the whole time. <\/p><p>My fears were unfounded, of course. I\u2019ve received inspiring emails from strangers. I\u2019ve had mostly good reviews. I hear it might even make money someday. <\/p><p>I should feel relieved. I should feel <em>ecstatic<\/em>. But vulnerability doesn\u2019t work that way. I still feel this intense desire to hide, to deflect, to cover back up all those parts I exposed to the world.<\/p><p>I\u2019ve distanced myself from past projects; I\u2019ve avoided pushing for the sort of work I really want; I\u2019ve glossed over details to avoid admitting how little I actually know. I\u2019ve worked hard, terribly hard, to make my checklist add up to a good job. <\/p><p>But I am not great. Not yet. <\/p><h2>Professionally vulnerable<\/h2><p>There\u2019s a safety in creating distance\u2014in carefully managing perceptions and avoiding the things that make you feel unprepared and unworthy. It\u2019s easier to get by when you have a buffer.<\/p><p>But that distance not only keeps you from greatness; it also numbs you. It protects you from your own emotions, sure. But it also makes it impossible to feel anyone else\u2019s. <\/p><p>I can\u2019t afford to be numb. I have users to help. I have problems to solve.

Corey Vilhauer has\ncalled it \u201c[content strategy\u2019s hidden\ndeliverable](http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/blendinteractive\/empathy-content-strategys-hidden-deliverable-cs-forum-2012).\u201d\nKate Kiefer Lee says it\u2019s [central to MailChimp\u2019s\ncontent](http:\/\/uxmag.com\/articles\/tone-and-voice-showing-your-users-that-you-care).

As much as I want to have it, as much as I believe in it, I fall down on the job a\nlot. I dole out advice better than I listen. I get frustrated with people who just can\u2019t figure things out.\nI\u2019m quick to be an editor when I ought to simply be a friend. \n\nI think I might have found the real problem, though. We can\u2019t begin being empathetic when another person\narrives. We have to already have made a space in our lives where empathy can thrive. And that means being\nopen\u2014truly open\u2014to feeling emotions we may not want to feel. It means allowing another\u2019s experiences to\ngut us. It means ceding control.\n\nEmpathy begins with vulnerability. And being vulnerable, especially in our work, is fucking terrifying.\n\n## Fronting\n\nI\u2019ve spent most of my life putting up one front or another: against middle-school taunts, against familial\ndrama, against injustices both petty and profound.

As a juvenile discipline that is\nnebulous in its boundaries we struggle to create words to define ourselves. So we are inevitably forced to\nsearch for analogues.\n\nLately we have seen a rise in the use of the word \u2018craftsmanship\u2019 to describe our work. This term evokes\nvarious positive adjectives\u2014hand-crafted, quality, unique, personal, bespoke\u2014and can be seen as part of a\nbroader appreciation of the art of making. I\u2019m as guilty as the next person for appropriating this word but\nI am increasingly feeling that \u2018craftsmanship\u2019 has become an unhelpful term for describing what we do.\n\nThe first problem is that if we choose to see the web designer as artisan then we begin to see the website as\nartefact. This objectification of websites leads to fetishism\u2014where we come to value a 400 x 300 pixel\nscreenshot[*](#fn1) more than a moment of interaction, a subtle change in navigation, an engaging feedback\nmessage, a beautifully executed form submission. We lust after representations rather than relishing the\nsubstances that they are composed from and the processes that inform them. And we come to see ourselves as the\npeddlers of goods rather than services.\n\nSecondly, the word craftsmanship is bound up with a particular practice of working and, more importantly a\nparticular practice of learning: a practice that emphasises repetition and mastery and the passing of\nknowledge from one (the master) to another (the apprentice). Of course we refine our technique with doing;\npractice makes perfect. But is it not the ultimate beauty of working on the web that we can never be its\nmaster?

I have little knowledge of psychology, but it seems that humans find it difficult to make reasoned decisions to complex problems (problems with many possible outcomes) and so often rely on intuition to solve them. But when a binary alternative offers itself, we will often take the shortcut and assume there are no alternative solutions. It is also far more easy to communicate the simple binary answer than the complex one.<\/p><blockquote><p>A false dilemma (also called false dichotomy) is a type of informal fallacy that involves a situation in which limited alternatives are considered, when in fact there is at least one additional option. The options may be a position that is between two extremes (such as when there are shades of grey) or may be completely different alternatives.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/False_dilemma\">Wikipedia<\/a><\/p><p>For example, if you ask someone whether they like cats or dogs, they will very often answer with one or the other. The reality is never so simple. All people somewhat like\/dislike cats and somewhat like\/dislike dogs. Nobody likes all cats and nobody likes all dogs. This is an example of false dilemma, as there are more than two answers. Very few things are black and white, and yet we find it hard to acknowledge this.<\/p><p>Take the digital industry for example, I see false dilemma everywhere. We all make quick decisions on how to do things and then forget why we made that decision. One rule rarely fits all, and yet people often shoehorn a process, technology, framework or mindset into every project they work on. Some of the best craftspeople out there will make very few assumptions, as few as possible. Every decision will be reasoned, and based on the specific needs of the product they are creating. The design will flourish out of a multitude of nuanced decisions, bespoke to this one set of constraints.<\/p><p>We must also be ready to evolve, and I think we are much better at this. Generally, people in the digital industry embrace new technology and adopt it into their workflow. But perhaps we could still do better, especially when it comes to an evolving understanding in the nature of digital and what it means to people. Look around you, and see what everyone else is learning. Be ready to reassess your assumptions and move forwards. It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you were wrong, but that your understanding of how digital products are used can always be improved.

You ignore the bad parts for the good. You choose to stop the\ncycle of anger with a dash of cheer.\n\nYou can\u2019t force a good mood, but if you\u2019ve got one, use it well and hang on.\n\n[1](#r1)That\u2019s how I remembered it, anyway.

It\u2019s a one-in-tens-of-thousands genetic mutation that more or less makes me Bizarro Wolverine, if you\u2019ll pardon my mixing of comic universes.<\/p><p>It hits everyone a little differently, and I\u2019m fortunate enough not to have any of the particularly nasty kinds\u2014the ones where blood vessels and\/or organs are made of stretchy tissue paper, for example. I have a type where the only thing holding my joints in place are the joints themselves, more or less. I\u2019ll partially dislocate things\u2014fingers, wrists, shoulders, ankles\u2014a couple of times a day, just by way of using them normally. The upshot is that it isn\u2019t really painful popping something out of joint, the way it would be if I were put together right\u2014most times I don\u2019t notice. For example, I realized a few days ago that I hold my iPad with my left wrist partially out of joint, and I didn\u2019t even notice. The downside is that my joints hurt, every day, for as long as I\u2019ve known me. I take a lot of Motrin, and I carry a roll of hockey tape with me.<\/p><p>When I was a kid\u2014real young\u2014I had to sleep with metal bars binding my feet together so my hips wouldn\u2019t be out of their sockets all night. My parents were told I\u2019d likely never walk\u2014not normally, anyway\u2014but I lucked out there.

I waited in the office with my mom until the doctor arrived. He was there with two or three residents. They all wore white medical robes. <\/p><p>The doctor had me stand, look at him, turn around to face away from him, bend over to touch my toes, stand up, and turn around to face him again.

I stood there.<\/p><p>The doctor, an ever-changing group of residents, and I repeated this examination dance for the next thirteen years. <\/p><p>I was five years old when I discovered that I have scoliosis\u2014basically my back curves in very interesting ways.

For social reasons, it wasn\u2019t the ideal time to find out that I was about to endure a treatment that would make me visibly different from my classmates. But in eighth grade, I realized there was no escaping it\u2014my scoliosis had become significantly worse\u2014I was about to enter a world of being discernibly distinct. <\/p><p>To be fitted for my hardshell back brace I had to go to a different specialist. This specialist was a rather creepy guy who had scraggily long, white hair and an untidy, long beard to match. He wore a white (were it not stained) ribbed sleeveless undershirt (as his only shirt). I disrobed to my undergarments and then I was wrapped in elastic bandage material. Then, this specialist rubbed plaster of Paris material from my neck down past my hips. I waited uncomfortably while the chalky, gloopy material hardened. <\/p><p>This was the first time I really realized how uncomfortable my life was about to become. <\/p><p>After the material set, the specialist marked the hardened form so he would know where he needed to leave a cutaway to accommodate a developing young lady\u2019s body.

He made slight adjustments and I started to wear the device. <\/p><p>For the next two years, I wore the contraption for 23 hours each and every day. I wore it at school, at home, and even in bed. I wore four layers of tops every day: an undergarment, a men\u2019s sleeved undershirt, the back brace, and an oversized shirt to try to disguise the other three layers. <\/p><p>I was not allowed to take gym class, which also meant no more extracurricular activities like basketball or cheerleading. I understood that wearing the back brace could prevent me from having surgery but at 13 years old, the entire experience seemed devastating. <\/p><p>One day, I was sitting in the bleachers watching my classmates participating in gym class. They were trying to climb the ropes. It dawned on me, I really disliked trying to climb the ropes in gym class.

More specifically: what events\nwill get created that engage the talented people in the intermediate to advanced range?\n\nSince attending my first [FOWD](http:\/\/futureofwebdesign.com\/landing-page) in 2009, I\u2019ve noticed serious\ngrowth in the number of available events. In the U.S. and the U.K., you can attend a high-quality event every\nmonth.\n\nThere are many events that are a mix of beginner-to-intermediate topics and some events where topics lean\ntowards the thought leaders. While everyone can benefit from the camaraderie and inspiration that comes from\nattending any of these, many reach a level where only a couple of presentations at an event teach them\nsomething new.\n\nDuring this growth period in skill development, the bulk of learning is done hands-on (preferably working with\npeople who have more advanced and varied skills). I\u2019d love to see some events pop up that are focused on\nthis group.\n\nI\u2019m thinking that they would take pieces from conferences, workshops, hackathons and competitions like\nthe [Rails Rumble](http:\/\/railsrumble.com).

But some of the time. You\u2019re going to do things you don\u2019t like,\nsometimes. You\u2019re going to do things you don\u2019t love, most of the time.\n\nImagine your dream job. Let\u2019s say you want to be a rock star. A rock star! You love music, you love\nperforming, you love fans, you love groupies. How much of your time do you spend actually doing what you love?\nTen percent? Let\u2019s be generous and say you spend twenty-five percent of your time actually being a rock\nstar. A quarter of the time you spend working is spent actually performing music for your adoring fans, and\nreaping the other associated benefits.\n\nWhat happens the rest of the time? Long lonely bus rides or plane rides to dreary towns, where you stay in\nfaceless hotels. Frustrating arguments with bandmates. Interminable hours spent trying to write new music,\nquestioning whether your next album will be as good as the last one. Soul-deadening meetings with corporate\nA&R types, the vampires of your industry. Self-doubt, magnified by the sharp words of music critics. Your job,\nit sucks.\n\nAnd that\u2019s if you\u2019re a rock star. But the same is true (in varying proportions) whether\nyou\u2019re a waiter or a designer or a teacher or a developer.\n\nMany of us are deeply committed to the work that we do, passionate about having found employment that so\nnaturally maps to our skills, focused on making the world a better place by making better products for people\nto use. I\u2019ve conducted hundreds of job interviews in my life, and I\u2019ve developed an eye for the\ntrue believers. I joke that I can spot the naturals by the chip implanted in their brain that convinces them\nthey were programmed from birth to think UX design is the perfect job for them.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not. It sucks. Some of the time.\n\nIf you\u2019re doing work you like to do more than twenty-five percent of the time, you\u2019re doing great.\nBut I\u2019m convinced the secret to real job satisfaction isn\u2019t trying to maximize your time spent\ndoing what you love. It\u2019s learning to tolerate and accept the downsides. It\u2019s being able to look\nthe parts of the job you don\u2019t like squarely in the eye and say \u201cI can deal with you.\u201d\n\nNote that I didn\u2019t say \u201clove\u201d the downsides. Or \u201cembrace.\u201d Or \u201ctransform\ninto something you truly enjoy.\u201d The parts of your job that suck are just that: sucky. You can\u2019t\nwish them into something better. You are never going to like them.\n\nWhatever it is about your job that you hate\u2014whether it\u2019s content inventories or detailed functional\nspecifications or recruiting for usability tests or monthly invoicing or schmoozing potential clients at\nconferences\u2014it doesn\u2019t take away from the parts of your job that you truly love.

If you worry too early about whether or not your code is \u2018good\u2019 before you\neven have something working, you\u2019ll be wasting your time and sometimes you won\u2019t even get to programming.\nYou\u2019ll spin your wheels and doubt every line you write or don\u2019t write and eventually you are beating\nyourself up about code you haven\u2019t even written yet. You\u2019ll procrastinate while you worry about details\nthat don\u2019t matter, and then you\u2019ll wonder why programming is so hard. It\u2019s not hard, but you\u2019re doing\nthings in the wrong order. Your desire for goodness is healthy but the satisfaction of it must be delayed.\n\nGet it up, then get it right.\n\nWhen you\u2019re just starting out\u2014whether you\u2019re learning to program for the first time, or maybe learning a\nnew trick for your trade\u2014you should measure your success by only one criteria:\n\n*Does the program do what I want it to for the end-user? (If you\u2019re a beginner, then this is probably\nyourself.)*\n\nAnd that\u2019s all. If you can answer this question with \u2018yes\u2019, then what you are making is good. Don\u2019t\nworry about what anyone else might think about your code. Don\u2019t even worry about what you think of your code\nyet. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to show what you\u2019re making to anyone until you\u2019re ready, if at all. Get it out dirty and\nfast and messy if you need to, with passion and without remorse. Nobody has to see your first draft. A novel\nis not written from beginning to end and then shipped to the publisher without being edited or revised. Code\nis not written once and then deployed to the users without testing and iteration. Write something, anything,\nand then come back to it; put your ego aside so that it\u2019s just you and your creativity and your fingertips.\n\n\n[*](#r1) Note that for all intents and purposes in this piece, \u2018interpreter\u2019 can be substituted for\n\u2018compiler\u2019 to reflect your language of craft accordingly.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @angelinamagnum on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/angelina-fabbro\/28-01-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Angelina Fabbro","slug":"angelina-fabbro","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/angelina-fabbro\/2013-january-28","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1697997711\/grainyme_bigger.jpg"},{"pubdate":"1359273600","date":"2013-january-27","nicedate":"Sunday, 27 January 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>The web is awesome.

It was time to say goodbye to Mrs. McCarthy and hello to my sixth grade math\nteacher, Mrs. Chaney.\n\nAs I held the yellow paper of the Iowa standardized test in my hands, my mom and I talked about Mrs. McCarthy\nand the fun of learning. My mom and I have both been educators. She was a physical education teacher. I\u2019ve\ncome to understand that physical education is the epitome of learning through doing, learning through playing.\nMy mom and I talked about the importance of learning through doing. Then my mom said, \u201cMrs. Chaney stole\nmath from you.\u201d I looked at my mom. Her face had a mix of anger, frustration, and sadness.\n\nI vividly remember being eleven years old, in my sixth grade math class, sitting in straight rows, instead of\nsmall groups like we sat in fifth grade. In Mrs. Chaney\u2019s class, I sat in the middle of the classroom. My\nlast name started with a \u201cJ\u201d and we were seated alphabetically\u2014middle letter of the alphabet meant\nmiddle of the classroom. I remember raising my hand over and over again to participate in the class. I had\nanswers and I had questions. I was in the middle of the classroom and I knew my teacher could see me raise my\nhand. I don\u2019t ever remember being called on but I do remember the boys in the class being called on. Mrs.\nChaney only called on the boys. After some time, I realized that raising my hand was an exercise in futility\nand I stopped raising my hand. I stopped engaging in the class, I stopped feeling smart in math, and I stopped\nloving math. I started to realize that gender had meaning far beyond \u201cpink is for girls\u201d and \u201cblue is\nfor boys.\u201d I understood the lesson Mrs. Chaney was teaching\u2014only boys could do math.\n\nSixth grade is the year math was taken from me. Although I use numbers on a daily basis, I\u2019ve never felt the\nlove that I once had for them. I\u2019ve decided to change this. I\u2019ve decided that twenty+ years after math was\ntaken from me that I\u2019m taking it back.\n\nI\u2019ve also decided to be more aware about myself and the people in my life. I will not allow anyone to take\nthe things I love away from me. I will not let the things I love go easily and I will do my best not to take\nthe things other people love away from them. I will fight for what I am passionate about but I will remind\nmyself that my own words affect others.","twitter_announcement":"Freshly baked. @jenseninman on @thepastrybox. http:\/\/the-pastry-box-project.net\/leslie-jensen-inman\/24-01-2013","role":"guest","realname":"Leslie Jensen-Inman","slug":"leslie-jensen-inman","permalink":"http:\/\/lab.the-pastry-box-project.net\/leslie-jensen-inman\/2013-january-24","photo":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2920389624\/fc1dfb64eaf1d0ec24502ca528859930_bigger.jpeg"},{"pubdate":"1358928000","date":"2013-january-23","nicedate":"Wednesday, 23 January 2013","title":"","thought":"<p>Maybe I&#8217;m noticing it more with the end-of-the-year roundups, but time is such a slippery thing on the web.

If they weren&#8217;t, though, it could just be gone forever. This makes me wonder what we should be doing to preserve things from this digital world that we are creating.<\/p><p>Originally, my concern was about whether the story of how the internet was created will be preserved as we progress. There are important things like the introduction of images, CSS, JavaScript, etc. For example, I would love to be able to see the &#8220;Batman Forever&#8221; site that got Jeffrey Zeldman started with web building. Preserving examples of the internet&#8217;s growth is tiny compared to the bigger impact that this could have, though.<\/p><p>As we move more parts of our daily life to bits instead of materials, are we risking their total loss? We have learned so much about human life by archeologists piecing together drawings, writings, tools and personal items found from people that lived long before us. As we do less of that on materials that don&#8217;t require power, I believe that we have to be more adamant about ensuring that there is a way to protect them.<\/p><p>It seems like we need a plan for preserving things both digitally and physically. Like we do with national parks or historic zoning, maybe we should protect significant properties.

When I got bored of playing the MechWarrior and Pitfall games that came with it, I began scouring the web to learn how I could create my own website.<\/p><p>I struggled, a lot. I found basic how-to guides online, but I often had questions that went unanswered. I didn&#8217;t have any friends who I could ask for advice, and back then there were no classes in school that taught web design, so I couldn&#8217;t ask my teachers. I didn&#8217;t understand the concept of mailing lists. I didn&#8217;t know how IRC worked, but that didn&#8217;t matter since I didn&#8217;t know there were chat rooms out there, anyway.<\/p><p>There was definitely one good thing, though, about learning on a younger web. When I finally did figure it out, I was surprised at how easy it actually was. Armed with a text editor, all I really needed to learn was some basic HTML.<\/p><p>The learning curve was nowhere near as steep as it is today. Think about how simple browser testing was. Slapping a &#8220;Best Viewed In X&#8221; button on a splash page pretty much meant that, hey, you weren&#8217;t responsible if the site looked bad for another user. And let&#8217;s face it\u2014expectations for design on the web were pretty rock-bottom back then. As long as your site had a few GIFs and a Webring graphic, you were pretty much good to go.<\/p><p>Fast-forward fifteen years. I&#8217;ve often thought about how it must feel to be a complete newbie these days who&#8217;d like to get started in web design and make <em>really cool stuff<\/em> from scratch. Today&#8217;s bar is set much, much higher.<\/p><p>Recently, a friend of mine decided that he wanted to learn how to make his own website. He&#8217;d heard of basic things like HTML and CSS, but a little bit of digging unearthed a whole other pile of terms he didn&#8217;t understand\u2014wireframing, content management systems, frameworks, responsive design\u2014the list went on. He was overwhelmed, and I certainly couldn&#8217;t blame him\u2014even seasoned pros can&#8217;t possibly stay on top of every new thing.<\/p><p>As overwhelming as the web has become today, though, we&#8217;re lucky to have more resources than ever, and more importantly, we have a much stronger community. My friend was able to ask numerous people for opinions and advice, pick up a magazine, choose from a wealth of easy-to-read books, and try some basic online training courses. With some helpful guidance, he was able to get his own site up and running and learned a lot in the process.<\/p><p>I certainly hope that web design doesn&#8217;t become so complicated that it will discourage new talent from getting involved. Experienced designers should make the time and effort to help each other and pass their skills along to the next generation so that ten years from now, the web will be even better than we can dream of. <\/p>","thought_raw":"<p>I received my very first computer in 1998 at the age of 15.
